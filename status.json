This ensures future IP changes do not cause outages.\u2028\r\n\r\n2.

Unauthenticated requests from Actions jobs, such as release downloads, were also impacted. Authenticated traffic was not impacted. This was due to a severe spike in traffic, primarily to search endpoints.Our immediate response focused on identifying and mitigating the source of the traffic increase, which along with automated traffic management restored full service for our users.We improved limiters for load to relevant endpoints and are continuing work to more proactively identify these large changes in traffic volume, improve resilience in critical request flows, and improve our time to mitigation.Dec23,00:17UTCUpdate-All services at healthy levels. We're finalizing the change to prevent future degradations from the same source.Dec23,00:06UTCUpdate-We're investigating elevated traffic affecting GitHub services, primarily impacting logged-out users with some increased latency on Issues.
