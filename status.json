No other GitHub services, including other Copilot services were impacted. This was due to a database migration causing a schema drift.We mitigated the incident by synchronizing the schema. We have hardened the service to make sure schema drift does not cause any further incidents, and will investigate improvements in our deployment pipeline to shorten time to mitigation in the future.Dec18,19:09UTCUpdate-Copilot is operating normally.Dec18,19:09UTCUpdate-We have observed full recovery with updating copilot policy settings, and are validating that that there is no further impact.Dec18,19:05UTCUpdate-Copilot is experiencing degraded performance. We are continuing to investigate.Dec18,18:43UTCUpdate-We have identified the source of this regression and are preparing a fix for deployment. We will update again in one hour.Dec18,18:10UTCUpdate-We are seeing an increase in errors on the User and Org policy settings page when updating policies. The errors are affecting the user copilot policies settings page, org copilot policies settings page when updating a policy.Dec18,17:36UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Dec18,17:36UTCIntermittent networking failures across GitHub-hosted Actions runnersResolved-On December 18th, 2025, from 08:15 UTC to 17:11 UTC, some GitHub Actions runners experienced intermittent timeouts for Github API calls, which led to failures during runner setup and workflow execution. This was caused by network packet loss between runners in the West US region and one of GitHub\u2019s edge sites. Approximately 1.5% of jobs on larger and standard hosted runners in the West US region were impacted, 0.28% of all Actions jobs during this period.By 17:11 UTC, all traffic was routed away from the affected edge site, mitigating the timeouts. We are working to improve early detection of cross-cloud connectivity issues and faster mitigation paths to reduce the impact of similar issues in the future.Dec18,17:41UTCUpdate-We are observing recovery with request from GitHub-hosted Actions runners and will continue to monitor.Dec18,17:29UTCUpdate-Since approximately 8:00 UTC, we have observed intermittent failures on GitHub-hosted actions runners. The failures have been observed both during runner setup, and workflow execution. We are continuing to investigate.Self-hosted runners are not impacted.Dec18,16:35UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for ActionsDec18,16:33UTCDec17,2025No incidents reported.Dec16,2025Incident With CopilotResolved-From 11:50-12:25 UTC, Copilot Coding Agent was unable to process new agent requests.  This affected all users creating new jobs during this timeframe, while existing jobs remained unaffected.  The cause of this issue was a change to the actions configuration where Copilot Coding Agent runs, which caused the setup of the Actions runner to fail, and the issue was resolved by rolling back this change.As a short term solution, we hope to increase our alerting criteria so that we can be alerted more quickly when an incident occurs, and in the long term we hope to harden our runner configuration to be more resilient against errors.Dec16,12:00UTCDec15,2025Copilot Code Review is degraded, and not returning responses to usersResolved-On December 15, 2025, between 15:15 UTC and 18:22 UTC, Copilot Code Review experienced a service degradation that caused 46.97% of pull request review requests to fail, requiring users to re-request a review. Impacted users saw the error message: \u201cCopilot encountered an error and was unable to review this pull request. You can try again by re-requesting a review.\u201d The remaining requests completed successfully.The degradation was caused by elevated response times in an internal, model-backed dependency, which led to request timeouts and backpressure in the review processing pipeline, resulting in sustained queue growth and failed review completion.We mitigated the issue by temporarily bypassing fix suggestions to reduce latency, increasing worker capacity to drain the backlog, and rolling out a model configuration change that reduced end-to-end latency. Queue depth and request success rates returned to normal and remained stable through peak traffic.Following the incident, we increased baseline worker capacity, added instrumentation for worker utilization and queue health, and are improving automatic load-shedding, fallback behavior, and alerting to reduce time to detection and mitigation for similar issues.Dec15,18:22UTCUpdate-We have seen recovery for Copilot Code Review requests and are investigating long-term availability and scaling strategiesDec15,18:21UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Dec15,17:43UTCIncident with Copilot Grok Code Fast 1Resolved-On Dec 15th, 2025, between 14:00 UTC and 15:45 UTC the Copilot service was degraded for Grok Code Fast 1 model. On average, 4% of the requests to this model failed due to an issue with our upstream provider. No other models were impacted.The issue was resolved after the upstream provider fixed the problem that caused the disruption. GitHub will continue to enhance our monitoring and alerting systems to reduce the time it takes to detect and mitigate similar issues in the future.Dec15,15:45UTCUpdate-We are continuing to work with our provider on resolving the incident with Grok Code Fast 1. Users can expect some requests to intermittently fail until all issues are resolved.Dec15,15:06UTCUpdate-We are experiencing degraded availability for the Grok Code Fast 1 model in Copilot Chat, VS Code and other Copilot products. This is due to an issue with an upstream model provider. We are working with them to resolve the issue.Other models are available and working as expected.Dec15,14:13UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for CopilotDec15,14:12UTCDec14,2025No incidents reported.Dec13,2025No incidents reported.Dec12,2025No incidents reported.\u2190Incident HistoryPowered by Atlassian StatuspageGitHub text logoSubscribe to our developer newsletterGet tips, technical guides, and best practices.
