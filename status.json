cloud-provider maintenance event will affect some GPU-accelerated compute resources. \r\n\r\nMaintenance Window\r\n- Start: Friday, January 23, 2026, at 17:00 UTC\r\n- End: Saturday, January 24, 2026, at 17:00 UTC (Expected)\r\n\r\nServices Impacted\r\n\r\nDuring this maintenance period, customers may experience interruptions or downtime across the following Databricks services:\r\n\r\n- Open Source Foundation Model Serving (Llama, Qwen, Gemma, GPT OSS, GTE, BGE)\r\n- AI Functions (including ai_query and ai_parse_document)\r\n- Vector Search\r\n- Databricks Assistant\r\n- Databricks Data Classification\r\n\r\nWorkloads actively running on GPU instances at the start of the maintenance window may be interrupted, placed in a queue, or require a manual restart once the window concludes. We advise completing or re-routing time-sensitive GPU tasks prior to the scheduled start time if possible.\r\n\r\nAction for Mitigation: Enable Cross-Geo Processing\r\n\r\nTo minimize service disruptions, we strongly recommend that customers enable cross-Geo processing where possible.  Refer to: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/resources/databricks-geos#cross-geo-processing\r\n\r\n\u200b\u200bNote 1: Enabling cross-Geo processing may result in workload execution or data processing occurring outside of your primary region. For customers with data residency, data locality, or regulatory constraints, this may not be permissible. Please review your organizational policies and compliance requirements before enabling this setting.\r\n\r\nNote 2: Llama 3 Provisioned Throughput will remain impacted by this event regardless of whether cross-Geo processing is enabled. If you are using Llama 3 Provisioned Throughput, we recommend upgrading to a newer model, such as GPT-OSS, and enabling cross-geo processing.StatusHistorySubscribe to receive status updates by emailCloseSubscribeManage SubscriptionManage Existing SubscriptionCreate New SubscriptionSubscribe to receive status updates by webhookEach status update will POST a JSON payload to this URLEmail address for managing webhookCloseSubscribeManage SubscriptionManage Existing SubscriptionCreate New SubscriptionSubscribe to receive status updates in Microsoft TeamsEnter your Microsoft Teams webhook.View InstructionsEmail address for managing subscriptionCloseSubscribeManage SubscriptionManage Existing SubscriptionCreate New SubscriptionSubscribe to receive status updates in SlackSlack channel IDFind the channel ID:Select the channel in your Slack workspace.

You should start to see more runs succeeding.If you do see failing runs, please retry and they might succeed.Jan26,20:10UTCUpdate-We've applied a mitigation to unblock running Actions. A regression occurred for Windows runners in public repositories which caused Actions workflows to fail. A mitigation is in place and customers should expect to see resolution soon.If you have a failing Actions workflow on a Windows runner, please retry and it is likely to work.Jan26,19:32UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Jan26,19:25UTCJan25,2026Disruption with repo creationResolved-Between January 24, 2026,19:56 UTC and January 25, 2026, 2:50 UTC repository creation and clone were degraded. On average, the error rate was 25% and peaked at 55% of requests for repository creation. This was due to increased latency on the repositories database impacting a read-after-write problem during repo creation. We mitigated the incident by stopping an operation that was generating load on the database to increase throughput.We have identified the repository creation problem and are working to address the issue and improve our observability to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.Jan25,03:08UTCUpdate-The issue has been resolved. We will continue to monitor to ensure stability.Jan25,03:08UTCUpdate-Repo creation failure rate increased above 50%. We have mitigated the problem and are monitoring for recovery.Jan25,02:58UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Jan25,02:43UTCJan24,2026No incidents reported.Jan23,2026No incidents reported.Jan22,2026Disruption with some GitHub servicesResolved-This incident has been resolved.

A detailed root cause analysis will be shared as soon as it is available.Jan22,15:22UTCUpdate-We have identified an issue in one of our services and have mitigated it. Services have recovered and we have a mitigation but we are working on a longer term solution.Jan22,15:22UTCUpdate-Issues is operating normally.Jan22,14:27UTCUpdate-Issues is experiencing degraded performance. We are continuing to investigate.Jan22,14:23UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Jan22,14:12UTCJan21,2026Policy pages for Copilot are timing outResolved-On January 21, between 17:50 and 20:53 UTC, around 350 enterprises and organizations experienced slower load times or timeouts when viewing Copilot policy pages. The issue was traced to performance degradation under load due to an issue in upstream database caching capability within our billing infrastructure, which increased query latency to retrieve billing and policy information from approximately 300ms to up to 1.5s.To restore service, we disabled the affected caching feature, which immediately returned performance to normal. We then addressed the issue in the caching capability and re-enabled our use of the database cache and observed continued recovery.Moving forward, we\u2019re tightening our procedures for deploying performance optimizations, adding test coverage, and improving cross-service visibility and alerting so we can detect upstream degradations earlier and reduce impact to customers.Jan21,20:53UTCUpdate-We are rolling out a fix to reduce latency and timeouts on policy pages and are continuing to monitor impact.Jan21,20:47UTCUpdate-We are continuing to investigate latency and timeout issues affecting Copilot policy pages.Jan21,20:12UTCUpdate-We are investigating timeouts for customers visiting the Copilot policy pages for organizations and enterprises.Jan21,19:37UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Jan21,19:31UTCCopilot Chat - Grok Code Fast 1 OutageResolved-On Jan 21st, 2025, between 11:15 UTC and 13:00 UTC the Copilot service was degraded for Grok Code Fast 1 model. On average, more than 90% of the requests to this model failed due to an issue with an upstream provider. No other models were impacted.The issue was resolved after the upstream provider fixed the problem that caused the disruption. GitHub will continue to enhance our monitoring and alerting systems to reduce the time it takes to detect and mitigate similar issues in the future.Jan21,12:38UTCUpdate-We are experiencing degraded availability for the Grok Code Fast 1 model in Copilot Chat, VS Code and other Copilot products. This is due to an issue with an upstream model provider. We are working with them to resolve the issue.Other models are available and working as expected.Jan21,12:09UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for CopilotJan21,11:33UTCJan20,2026Run start delays in ActionsResolved-On January 20, 2026, between 19:08 UTC and 20:18 UTC, manually dispatched GitHub Actions workflows saw delayed job starts. GitHub products built on Actions such as Dependabot, Pages builds, and Copilot coding agent experienced similar delays. All jobs successfully completed despite the delays. At peak impact, approximately 23% of workflow runs were affected, with an average delay of 11 minutes.This was caused by a load pattern shift in Actions scheduled jobs that saturated a shared backend resource. We mitigated the incident by temporarily throttling traffic and scaling up resources to account for the change in load pattern. To prevent recurrence, we have scaled resources appropriately and implemented optimizations to prevent this load pattern in the future.Jan20,20:10UTCUpdate-We are investigating delays in manually dispatched Actions workflows as well as other GitHub products which run on Actions. We have identified a fix and are working on mitigating the delays.Jan20,19:56UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for ActionsJan20,19:49UTCIncident affecting actions-runner-controllerResolved-On January 20, 2026, between 14:39 UTC and 16:03 UTC, actions-runner-controller users experienced a 1% failure rate for API requests managing GitHub Actions runner scale sets. This caused delays in runner creation, resulting in delayed job starts for workflows targeting those runners. The root cause was a service to service circuit breaker that incorrectly tripped for all users when a single user hit rate limits for runner registration. The issue was mitigated by bypassing the circuit breaker, and users saw immediate and full service recovery following the fix.We have updated our circuit breakers to exclude individual customer rate limits from their triggering logic and are continuing work to improve detection and mitigation times.Jan20,16:23UTCUpdate-GitHub Actions customers that use actions-runner-controller are experiencing errors from our APIs that informs auto-scaling. We are investigating the issue and working on mitigating the impact.Jan20,16:03UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for ActionsJan20,16:02UTCJan19,2026No incidents reported.Jan18,2026No incidents reported.Jan17,2026Disruption with some GitHub servicesResolved-Between 2026-01-16 16:17 and 2026-01-17 02:54 UTC, some Copilot Business users were unable to access and use certain Copilot features and models. This was due to a bug with how we determine if a user has access to a feature, inadvertently marking features and models as inaccessible for users whose enterprise(s) had not configured the policy.We mitigated the incident by reverting the problematic deployment. We are improving our internal monitoring and mitigation processes to reduce the risk and extended downtime of similar incidents in the future.Jan17,02:54UTCUpdate-The fix has been deployed and the issue resolved. We will continue to monitor any incoming reports.Jan17,02:54UTCUpdate-The deployment of the fix is still ongoing. We are now targeting 3:00 AM UTC for full resolution.Jan17,02:25UTCUpdate-The deployment is still in progress. We are still targeting 2:00 AM UTC for full resolution.Jan17,02:21UTCUpdate-Deployment of the fix is in progress. We are still targetting 2:00 AM UTC for full resolution.Jan17,01:28UTCUpdate-Some enterprise Copilot CLI users may encounter an \"You are not authorized to use this Copilot feature\" error. We have identified the root cause and are currently deploying a fix. Expected resolution: within 2 hours.Jan17,00:08UTCUpdate-We received multiple reports of 403s when attempting to use the Copilot CLI. We have identified the root cause and are rolling out a fix for affected customers.Jan16,23:53UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Jan16,23:53UTCJan16,2026Jan15,2026Incident with Issues and Pull RequestsResolved-On January 15, 2026,  between 16:40 UTC and 18:20 UTC, we observed increased latency and timeouts across Issues, Pull Requests, Notifications, Actions, Repositories, API, Account Login and Alive. An average 1.8% of combined web and API requests saw failure, peaking briefly at 10% early on. The majority of impact was observed for unauthenticated users, but authenticated users were impacted as well.This was caused by an infrastructure update to some of our data stores. Upgrading this infrastructure to a new major version resulted in unexpected resource contention, leading to distributed impact in the form of slow queries and increased timeouts across services that depend on these datasets. We mitigated this by rolling back to the previous stable version.We are working to improve our validation process for these types of upgrades to catch issues that only occur under high load before full release, improve detection time, and reduce mitigation times in the future.Jan15,18:54UTCUpdate-Pull Requests is operating normally.Jan15,18:54UTCUpdate-Issues and Pull Requests are experiencing degraded performance. We are continuing to investigate.Jan15,18:42UTCUpdate-We are seeing recovery across all services, but will continue to monitor before resolving.Jan15,18:36UTCUpdate-API Requests is operating normally.Jan15,17:51UTCUpdate-We are seeing some signs of recovery, particularly for authenticated users.

We are continuing to investigate.Jan15,17:06UTCUpdate-API Requests is experiencing degraded availability. We are continuing to investigate.Jan15,16:57UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded availability for API Requests, Actions, Issues and Pull RequestsJan15,16:56UTCActions workflow run and job status updates are experiencing delaysResolved-On January 15th, between 14:18 UTC and 15:26 UTC, customers experienced delays in status updates for workflow runs and checks. Status updates were delayed by up to 20 minutes, with a median delay of 11 minutes.The issue stemmed from an infrastructure upgrade to our database cluster. The new version introduced resource contention under production load, causing slow query times. We mitigated this by rolling back to the previous stable version. We are working to strengthen our upgrade validation process to catch issues that only manifest under high load. We are also adding new monitors to reduce detection time for similar issues in the future.Jan15,15:26UTCUpdate-We are continuing to monitor as the system recovers and expect full recovery within the next 20-30 minutes. Impacted users will see that job status appears queued, though the job itself is actually running.Jan15,15:12UTCUpdate-We are seeing signs of recovery and are continuing to monitor as we process the backlog of events.Jan15,14:55UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for ActionsJan15,14:24UTCJan14,2026Incident with WebhooksResolved-On January 14, 2026, between 19:34 UTC and 21:36 UTC, the Webhooks service experienced a degradation that delayed delivery of some webhooks. During this window, a subset of webhook deliveries that encountered proxy tunnel errors on their initial delivery attempt were delayed by more than two minutes. The root cause was a recent code change that added additional retry attempts for this specific error condition, which increased delivery times for affected webhooks. Previously, webhook deliveries encountering this error would not have been delivered.The incident was mitigated by rolling back the change, restoring normal webhook delivery.As a corrective action, we will update our monitoring to measure the webhook delivery latency critical path, ensuring that incidents are accurately scoped to this workflow.Jan14,21:38UTCUpdate-Some webhook deliveries are delayed, but we don\u2019t expect meaningful user impact. The delays are currently scoped only to deliveries that, until recently, would have failed more quickly. We will update status if conditions change.Jan14,20:41UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for WebhooksJan14,20:21UTC[Retroactive] Incident with GitHub Copilot (GPT-5 model)Resolved-From January 14, 2026, at 18:15 UTC until January 15, 2026, at 11:30 UTC, GitHub Copilot users were unable to select the GPT-5 model for chat features in VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, and other IDE integrations. Users running GPT-5 in Auto mode experienced errors. Other models were not impacted.We mitigated this incident by deploying a fix that corrected a misconfiguration in available models, rendering the GPT-5 model available again.We are improving our testing processes to reduce the risk of similar incidents in the future, and refining our model availability alerting to improve detection time.We did not status before we completed the fix, and the incident is currently resolved. We are sorry for the delayed post on githubstatus.com.Jan14,18:00UTCClaude Opus 4.5 model experiencing degraded performanceResolved-On January 14th, 2026, between approximately 10:20 and 11:25 UTC, the Copilot service experienced a degradation of the Claude Opus 4.5 model due to an issue with our upstream provider. During this time period, users encountered a 4.5% error rate when using Claude Opus 4.5. No other models were impacted.The issue was resolved by a mitigation put in place by our provider. GitHub is working with our provider to further improve the resiliency of the service to prevent similar incidents in the future.Jan14,12:23UTCUpdate-We are continuing to investigate issues with Claude Opus 4.5 and are working to restore performance across our model providers.Jan14,11:45UTCUpdate-We are experiencing issues with our Claude Opus 4.5 providers and are investigating remediation.Jan14,11:00UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Jan14,10:56UTCCopilot's GPT-5.1 model has degraded performanceResolved-This incident has been resolved.
