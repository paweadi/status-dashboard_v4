new platform. As part of this migration, the HMS backend databases will move to servers with new IP addresses and subnets.\r\n\r\nIf you currently reference Hive Metastore IP addresses directly in user-defined routes or firewalls, you must update your configuration before the maintenance window. Failure to update these rules will result in Hive Metastore access failures and service outages (e.g., job failures, cluster start failures).\r\n\r\nMaintenance Window\r\n\r\nThe migration will occur between 14:00 UTC and 16:00 UTC on January 12, 2025.\r\nEach region will experience a brief service interruption of approximately 30 minutes during this window.\r\n\r\nAction Required (must be completed prior to January 12, 2025)\r\n\r\nIf your environment uses hard-coded Hive Metastore IP addresses:\r\n\r\n1. Recommended:\u2028\r\nUpdate your user-defined routes or firewall rules (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/security/network/classic/udr#azure-service-tags) to use the Azure SQL service tag instead of static HMS IP addresses. This ensures future IP changes do not cause outages.\u2028\r\n\r\n2. If your security policy does not allow service tags:\u2028\r\nAdd the reserved IP ranges (https://community.databricks.com/t5/product-platform-updates/ip-cidr-for-azure-databricks-hive-metastore/ba-p/133401) for Hive Metastore to your routing or firewall rules.\u2028If supported, you may also allow the HMS FQDNs provided in the same documentation.\u2028\r\n\r\nCustomers who already allow Azure service tags or FQDN-based rules do not need to take further action and will not experience disruption to running jobs.\r\n\r\nThese actions must be completed by January 12, 2025.

During this time, all attempts to download artifacts from the web interface failed. Artifact downloads via the REST API and GitHub CLI were unaffected.This was due to a client-side change that was deployed to optimize performance when navigating between pages in a repository. We mitigated the incident by reverting the change.We are working to improve testing of related changes and to add monitoring coverage for artifact downloads through the web interface to reduce our time to detection and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.Jan6,17:06UTCUpdate-We are investigating issues downloading artifacts from Actions workflows.
