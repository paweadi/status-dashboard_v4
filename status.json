As part of this migration, the HMS backend databases will move to servers with new IP addresses and subnets.\r\n\r\nIf you currently reference Hive Metastore IP addresses directly in user-defined routes or firewalls, you must update your configuration before the maintenance window.

This ensures future IP changes do not cause outages.\u2028\r\n\r\n2.

\"IllegalArgumentException Unrecognized type LocalTime\".Resolved-This incident has been resolved. We have observed that instance rates are returning to normal levels, and affected connections are syncing successfully.Incident SummaryDescription:We identified an issue with the Pardot connections, which resulted in syncs failing with a 'IllegalArgumentException Unrecognized type LocalTime' error.Timeline:This issue began on January 8th, at around 17:00 UTC and was resolved on January 10th, at around 1:20 UTC.Cause:The incident was triggered by the rollout of the ENGAGEMENT_STUDIO_PROGRAM table, on 2026-01-07, as a result of which we tried to write an incompatible data type, LocalTime, to the destination. Consequently, the connectors failed during flush operations due to this.Resolution:Service was restored by pausing the rollout of the feature. A permanent fix has been submitted to transition the data mapping from LocalTime to String. The rollout of the ENGAGEMENT_STUDIO_PROGRAM table will be resumed in the upcoming days.Jan10,14:15UTCMonitoring-A fix has been implemented and we are monitoring the results.Jan10,14:00UTCUpdate-We have identified a data type mismatch affecting the Pardot connector. An incompatible LocalTime definition in the engagement_studio_program table introduced via a rollout on January 6 is currently unsupported by the BigQuery writer, leading to failure rate.We are working on a hotfix to address the IllegalArgumentException and resolve the issue.Jan10,10:28UTCIdentified-The issue has been identified and a fix is being implemented.Jan10,10:25UTCFivetran: Quickstart Transformations auto-enabled for existing ConnectionsResolved-A fix has been deployed to production to prevent transformations from being unintentionally created during connector setup tests. New connectors and edits will no longer trigger these transformations.Any previously created transformations that are still present and can be removed now. We are also working on a cleanup process to remove these jobs automatically where feasible.The incident is fully resolved and is no longer impacting customers. A detailed RCA will be shared within the next week.Jan10,01:21UTCMonitoring-A fix has been implemented and we are monitoring the results.Jan9,22:55UTCIdentified-The issue has been identified and we are working to resolve it.Jan9,18:55UTCJan9,20263rd Party: Few Ringcentral connections are failing with the not found errorResolved-This incident has been resolved. We have observed that instance rates are returning to normal levels, and affected connections are syncing successfully.Incident SummaryDescription:We identified an issue with the RingCentral connections, which resulted in syncs failing with a 'not found' error.Timeline:This issue began on January 9th, at 06:10 UTC and was resolved on January 9th, at 12:30 UTC.Cause:RingCentral\u2019s Meeting endpoint (v1.0/account/~/meeting/locked-settings) began unexpectedly returning 404 responses. We have engaged with RingCentral Support to investigate the underlying API issue on their side.Resolution:We handled the 404 exception by skipping this endpoint during syncs, allowing the remaining data to sync successfully.Jan9,13:28UTCMonitoring-A fix has been implemented and we are monitoring the results.Jan9,12:24UTCIdentified-The issue has been identified and we are working to resolve it.Jan9,11:55UTCJan8,20263rd Party: Reddit Ads connections are experiencing failures due to API authentication and server errorsResolved-This incident has been resolved. We have observed that instance rates are returning to normal levels and affected connectors are syncing successfully.Incident SummaryDescription:We\u2019ve identified that Reddit Ads connection syncs are experiencing failures due to API authentication and server errors.Timeline:This issue began on January 7th, 20:06 UTC and was resolved on January 8th, 9:20 UTC.Cause:The issue was caused by a third-party outage impacting the Reddit Ads Communities API. The API intermittently returned authentication and server-side errors, resulting in sync failures for affected Reddit Ads connections.Resolution:To mitigate the issue, we implemented a change to skip the problematic Reddit Ads Communities endpoint by placing UFL (User-Facing Limitation) information on the affected endpoint. In parallel, we have engaged Reddit Support to further investigate the underlying API issue on their side.Jan8,12:37UTCMonitoring-A fix has been implemented and we are monitoring the results.Jan8,10:59UTCUpdate-We\u2019ve identified that the failures are related to the Reddit Ads Communities API. We are working on a fix to skip the affected endpoint.In parallel, we\u2019ve contacted Reddit Support to further investigate the issue.Jan8,06:49UTCUpdate-We\u2019ve identified that Reddit Ads connection syncs are failing. The errors appear related to API authentication and intermittent server-side responses from Reddit Ads. Our team is investigating and monitoring closely; we\u2019ll share progress updates as they become available.Jan8,03:40UTCIdentified-The issue has been identified and we are working to resolve it.Jan8,01:20UTC3rd Party: Ramp connections are failing with \"403 Forbidden\" errorResolved-This incident has been resolved. We have observed that instance rates are returning to normal levels and affected connectors are syncing successfully.Incident SummaryDescription:We identified an issue with Ramp connections, which resulted in sync failures with a 403 Forbidden error.Timeline:This issue began on Jan 7, 2026, at  22:30 UTC and was resolved on Jan 8, 2026, at 08:40 UTC.Cause:Multiple endpoints (including Bill, Purchase Order, Business Entity, Vendor, Merchant, spend_program, and limits) require specific permissions to sync. A recent third-party change caused missing-permission errors to return a 403 Forbidden instead of a 400 Bad Request for these endpoints. This change bypassed the existing logic, resulting in connection sync failures.Resolution:We have implemented a fix to address the 403 Forbidden errors.Jan8,10:45UTCMonitoring-A fix has been implemented and we are monitoring the results.Jan8,10:20UTCIdentified-We are now observing 403 Forbidden errors on the spend_program and limits endpoints, in addition to the previously impacted endpoints. The issue is consistent with a scope-related insufficient permissions error.We are working on a hotfix to extend the fix to include these endpoints, handle the 403 Forbidden error, and fix the issue.Jan8,08:40UTCMonitoring-The hotfix has been deployed successfully. We are monitoring the connector syncs now.Jan8,06:13UTCUpdate-A hotfix has been created and is currently being deployedJan8,05:36UTCUpdate-Multiple endpoints (including Bill, Purchase Order, Business Entity, Vendor, and Merchant) require specific permissions to sync. A recent third-party change caused missing-permission errors to return a 403 Forbidden instead of a 400 Bad Request.

As this is a third-party issue, we have reached out to the source team for clarification and a permanent fix.Dec31,09:40UTCMonitoring-A fix has been implemented and we are monitoring the results.Dec31,09:01UTCUpdate-This issue is caused by a third-party API error on Ramp\u2019s side, and we have reached out to Ramp Source Support for clarification and resolution.In the meantime, we are adding an alert message for affected connections and will skip syncing the business_entity table.
