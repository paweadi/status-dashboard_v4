This scraper activity caused a low priority web request pool to increase and eventually exceed total capacity resulting in users experiencing 500 errors. In particular, this affected Login, Logout, and Signup routes, along with less than 1% requests from within Actions jobs. At the peak of the incident, 7.6% of login requests were impacted, which was the most significant impact of this scraping attack.Our mitigation strategy identified the scraping activity and blocked it. We also increased the pool of web requests that were impacted to have more capacity, and lastly we upgraded key user login routes to higher priority queues.In future, we\u2019re working to more proactively identify this particular scraper activity and have faster mitigation times.Dec11,20:05UTCUpdate-We see signs of full recovery and will post a more in-depth update soon.Dec11,20:05UTCUpdate-We are continuing to monitor and continuing to see signs of recovery. We will update when we are confident that we are in full recovery.Dec11,19:58UTCUpdate-We've applied a mitigation to fix intermittent failures in anonymous requests and downloads from GitHub, including Login, Signup, Logout, and some requests from within Actions jobs. We are seeing improvements in telemetry, but we will continue to monitor for full recovery.Dec11,19:04UTCUpdate-We currently have ~7% of users experiencing errors when attempting to sign up, log in, or log out. We are deploying a change to mitigate these failures.Dec11,18:47UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Dec11,18:40UTCWe are investigating a rise in request failures on several servicesResolved-This incident has been resolved.

Thank you for your patience and understanding as we addressed this issue. A detailed root cause analysis will be shared as soon as it is available.Dec10,14:52UTCUpdate-We've applied a mitigation to ensure all macOS jobs route to macOS fulfillers and are monitoring for full recovery.Dec10,14:32UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for ActionsDec10,13:34UTCSome Actions customers experiencing run start delaysResolved-On December 10, 2025 between 08:50 UTC and 11:00 UTC, some GitHub Actions workflow runs experienced longer-than-normal wait times for jobs starting or completing. All jobs successfully completed despite the delays. At peak impact, approximately 8% of workflow runs were affected.During this incident, some nodes received a spike in workflow events that led to queuing of event processing. Because runs are pinned to nodes, runs being processed by these nodes saw delays in starting or showing as completed. The team was alerted to this at 8:58 UTC. Impacted nodes were disabled from processing new jobs to allow queues to drain.We have increased overall processing capacity and are implementing safeguards to better balance load across all nodes when spikes occur. This is important to ensure our available capacity can always be fully utilized.Dec10,11:05UTCUpdate-Actions is operating normally.Dec10,11:05UTCUpdate-We have validated the mitigation and are no longer seeing impact.Dec10,11:05UTCUpdate-We are seeing improvements in telemetry and are monitoring for full recovery.Dec10,10:58UTCUpdate-We've applied a mitigation to fix the issues with queuing and running Actions jobs. We will continue monitoring to confirm whether this resolves the issue.Dec10,10:25UTCUpdate-The team continues to investigate issues with some Actions jobs being queued for a long time. We will continue providing updates on the progress towards mitigation.Dec10,09:41UTCUpdate-We're investigating Actions workflow runs taking longer than expected to start.Dec10,09:13UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for ActionsDec10,09:11UTCDec9,2025No incidents reported.Dec8,2025Disruption with some GitHub servicesResolved-On December 8, 2025, between 21:15 and 22:24 UTC, Copilot code completions experienced a significant service degradation. During this period, up to 65% of code completion requests failed.The root cause was an internal feature flag that caused the primary model supporting Copilot code completions to appear unavailable to the backend service. The issue was resolved once the flag was disabled.To prevent recurrence, we expanded test coverage for Copilot code completion models and are strengthening our detection mechanisms to better identify and respond to traffic anomalies.Dec8,22:33UTCUpdate-We are beginning to see signs of resolution after applying a mitigation. We expect full resolution within approximately 30 minutes.Dec8,22:10UTCUpdate-We're continuing to investigate and mitigate issues with the GPT 4o model for Copilot completions. Users can currently work around this issue by updating their VS Code settings with \"github.copilot.advanced.debug.overrideEngine\": \"gpt-41-copilot\".Dec8,22:04UTCUpdate-We are currently investigating failures with the GPT 4o model for Copilot completions.Dec8,21:32UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Dec8,21:28UTCPotential disruption with our Agent Control Plane UI SettingsResolved-On November 26th, 2025, between approximately 02:24 UTC and December 8th, 2025 at 20:26 UTC, enterprise administrators experienced a disruption when viewing agent session activities in the Enterprise AI Controls page. During this period, users were unable to list agent session activity in the AI Controls view. This did not impact viewing agent session activity in audit logs or directly navigating to individual agent session logs, or otherwise managing AI Agents.The issue was caused by a misconfiguration in a change deployed on November 25th that unintentionally prevented data from being published to an internal Kafka topic responsible for feeding the AI Controls page with agent session activity information.The problem was identified and mitigated on December 8th by correcting the configuration issue. GitHub is improving monitoring for data pipeline dependencies and enhancing pre-deployment validation to catch configuration issues before they reach production.Dec8,21:06UTCUpdate-We are investigating an incident affecting missing Agent Session data on the AI Settings page on Agent Control Plane.Dec8,19:52UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Dec8,19:51UTCDec7,2025No incidents reported.Dec6,2025No incidents reported.Dec5,2025Team synchronization is experiencing delays for non enterprise managed usersResolved-On December 5th, 2025, between 12:00 pm UTC and 9:00 pm UTC, our Team Synchronization service experienced a significant degradation, preventing over 209,000 organization teams from syncing their identity provider (IdP) groups. The incident was triggered by a buildup of synchronization requests, resulting in elevated Redis key usage and high CPU consumption on the underlying Redis cluster.To mitigate further impact, we proactively paused all team synchronization requests between 3:00 pm UTC and 8:15 pm UTC, allowing us to stabilize the Redis cluster. Our engineering team also resolved the issue by flushing the affected Redis keys and queues, which promptly stopped runaway growth and restored service health. Additionally, we scaled up our infrastructure resources to improve our ability to process the high volume of synchronization requests. All pending team synchronizations were successfully processed following service restoration.We are working to strengthen the Team Synchronization service by implementing a killswitch, adding throttling to prevent excessive enqueueing of synchronization requests, and improving the scheduler to avoid duplicate job requests. Additionally, we\u2019re investing in better observability to alert when job drops occur. These efforts are focused on preventing similar incidents and improving overall reliability going forward.Dec5,22:20UTCUpdate-We believe we reached a scaling limit and are increasing the amount of resources available to reduce the delays for the team synchronization process.Dec5,21:40UTCUpdate-We're continuing to investigate the delays in the team synchronization and will report back once we have more information.Dec5,19:17UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Dec5,18:38UTCDec4,2025No incidents reported.Dec3,2025Webhooks delivery degradationResolved-On December 3, 2025, between 22:21 UTC and 23:44 UTC, the Webhooks service experienced a degradation that delayed writes of webhook delivery records to our database. During this period, many webhook deliveries were not visible in the webhook delivery UI or API for more than an hour after they were sent. As a result, customers were temporarily unable to request redeliveries for those delayed records. The underlying cause was throttling of database writes due to high replication lag.We mitigated the incident by temporarily disabling delivery history for a small number of very high\u2011volume webhook owners to reduce write pressure and stabilize the service. We are contacting the affected customers directly with more details.We are improving our webhook delivery storage architecture so it can scale with current and future webhook traffic, reducing the likelihood and impact of similar issues.Dec3,22:30UTCDec2,2025No incidents reported.\u2190Incident HistoryPowered by Atlassian StatuspageGitHub text logoSubscribe to our developer newsletterGet tips, technical guides, and best practices.
