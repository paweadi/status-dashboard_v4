As part of this migration, the HMS backend databases will move to servers with new IP addresses and subnets.\r\n\r\nIf you currently reference Hive Metastore IP addresses directly in user-defined routes or firewalls, you must update your configuration before the maintenance window.

This ensures future IP changes do not cause outages.\u2028\r\n\r\n2.

The queue has returned to normal processing times, and we continue to monitor service health. We'll post another update by 11:00 UTC.Dec23,10:29UTCUpdate-We're experiencing delays in search indexing for Issues and Pull Requests. Search results may show data up to three minutes old due to elevated processing times in our indexing pipeline. We're working to restore normal performance. We'll post another update by 10:30 UTC.Dec23,09:58UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Issues and Pull RequestsDec23,09:56UTCDisruption with some GitHub servicesResolved-On December 22, 2025, between 22:01 UTC and 22:32 UTC, unauthenticated requests to github.com were degraded, resulting in slow or timed out page loads and API requests. Unauthenticated requests from Actions jobs, such as release downloads, were also impacted. Authenticated traffic was not impacted. This was due to a severe spike in traffic, primarily to search endpoints.Our immediate response focused on identifying and mitigating the source of the traffic increase, which along with automated traffic management restored full service for our users.We improved limiters for load to relevant endpoints and are continuing work to more proactively identify these large changes in traffic volume, improve resilience in critical request flows, and improve our time to mitigation.Dec23,00:17UTCUpdate-All services at healthy levels. We're finalizing the change to prevent future degradations from the same source.Dec23,00:06UTCUpdate-We're investigating elevated traffic affecting GitHub services, primarily impacting logged-out users with some increased latency on Issues. We're preparing additional mitigations to prevent further spikes.Dec22,23:32UTCUpdate-We are experiencing elevated traffic affecting some GitHub services, primarily impacting logged-out users. We're actively investigating the full scope and working to restore normal service. We'll post another update by 23:45 UTC.Dec22,22:57UTCUpdate-Issues is experiencing degraded performance. We are continuing to investigate.Dec22,22:48UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Dec22,22:31UTCDec22,2025Dec21,2025No incidents reported.Dec20,2025No incidents reported.Dec19,2025No incidents reported.Dec18,2025Disruption with some GitHub servicesResolved-On December 18, 2025, between 16:25 UTC and 19:09 UTC the service underlying Copilot policies was degraded and users, organizations, and enterprises were not able to update any policies related to Copilot. No other GitHub services, including other Copilot services were impacted. This was due to a database migration causing a schema drift.We mitigated the incident by synchronizing the schema. We have hardened the service to make sure schema drift does not cause any further incidents, and will investigate improvements in our deployment pipeline to shorten time to mitigation in the future.Dec18,19:09UTCUpdate-Copilot is operating normally.Dec18,19:09UTCUpdate-We have observed full recovery with updating copilot policy settings, and are validating that that there is no further impact.Dec18,19:05UTCUpdate-Copilot is experiencing degraded performance. We are continuing to investigate.Dec18,18:43UTCUpdate-We have identified the source of this regression and are preparing a fix for deployment. We will update again in one hour.Dec18,18:10UTCUpdate-We are seeing an increase in errors on the User and Org policy settings page when updating policies. The errors are affecting the user copilot policies settings page, org copilot policies settings page when updating a policy.Dec18,17:36UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Dec18,17:36UTCIntermittent networking failures across GitHub-hosted Actions runnersResolved-On December 18th, 2025, from 08:15 UTC to 17:11 UTC, some GitHub Actions runners experienced intermittent timeouts for Github API calls, which led to failures during runner setup and workflow execution. This was caused by network packet loss between runners in the West US region and one of GitHub\u2019s edge sites. Approximately 1.5% of jobs on larger and standard hosted runners in the West US region were impacted, 0.28% of all Actions jobs during this period.By 17:11 UTC, all traffic was routed away from the affected edge site, mitigating the timeouts. We are working to improve early detection of cross-cloud connectivity issues and faster mitigation paths to reduce the impact of similar issues in the future.Dec18,17:41UTCUpdate-We are observing recovery with request from GitHub-hosted Actions runners and will continue to monitor.Dec18,17:29UTCUpdate-Since approximately 8:00 UTC, we have observed intermittent failures on GitHub-hosted actions runners. The failures have been observed both during runner setup, and workflow execution. We are continuing to investigate.Self-hosted runners are not impacted.Dec18,16:35UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for ActionsDec18,16:33UTCDec17,2025No incidents reported.\u2190Incident HistoryPowered by Atlassian StatuspageGitHub text logoSubscribe to our developer newsletterGet tips, technical guides, and best practices.
