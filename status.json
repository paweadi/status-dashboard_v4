This scraper activity caused a low priority web request pool to increase and eventually exceed total capacity resulting in users experiencing 500 errors. In particular, this affected Login, Logout, and Signup routes, along with less than 1% requests from within Actions jobs. At the peak of the incident, 7.6% of login requests were impacted, which was the most significant impact of this scraping attack.Our mitigation strategy identified the scraping activity and blocked it. We also increased the pool of web requests that were impacted to have more capacity, and lastly we upgraded key user login routes to higher priority queues.In future, we\u2019re working to more proactively identify this particular scraper activity and have faster mitigation times.Dec11,20:05UTCUpdate-We see signs of full recovery and will post a more in-depth update soon.Dec11,20:05UTCUpdate-We are continuing to monitor and continuing to see signs of recovery.

The incident was triggered by a buildup of synchronization requests, resulting in elevated Redis key usage and high CPU consumption on the underlying Redis cluster.To mitigate further impact, we proactively paused all team synchronization requests between 3:00 pm UTC and 8:15 pm UTC, allowing us to stabilize the Redis cluster. Our engineering team also resolved the issue by flushing the affected Redis keys and queues, which promptly stopped runaway growth and restored service health. Additionally, we scaled up our infrastructure resources to improve our ability to process the high volume of synchronization requests. All pending team synchronizations were successfully processed following service restoration.We are working to strengthen the Team Synchronization service by implementing a killswitch, adding throttling to prevent excessive enqueueing of synchronization requests, and improving the scheduler to avoid duplicate job requests. Additionally, we\u2019re investing in better observability to alert when job drops occur. These efforts are focused on preventing similar incidents and improving overall reliability going forward.Dec5,22:20UTCUpdate-We believe we reached a scaling limit and are increasing the amount of resources available to reduce the delays for the team synchronization process.Dec5,21:40UTCUpdate-We're continuing to investigate the delays in the team synchronization and will report back once we have more information.Dec5,19:17UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Dec5,18:38UTCDec4,2025No incidents reported.Dec3,2025No incidents reported.Dec2,2025No incidents reported.Dec1,2025No incidents reported.Nov30,2025No incidents reported.Nov29,2025No incidents reported.Nov28,2025Incident with CopilotResolved-On November 28th, 2025, between approximately 05:51 and 08:04 UTC, Copilot experienced an outage affecting the Claude Sonnet 4.5 model. Users attempting to use this model received an HTTP 400 error, resulting in 4.6% of total chat requests during this timeframe failing. Other models were not impacted.The issue was caused by a misconfiguration deployed to an internal service which made Claude Sonnet 4.5 unavailable. The problem was identified and mitigated by reverting the change. GitHub is working to improve cross-service deploy safeguards and monitoring to prevent similar incidents in the future.Nov28,08:23UTCUpdate-We have rolled out a fix and are monitoring for recovery.Nov28,07:52UTCUpdate-We are investigating degraded performance with the Claude Sonnet 4.5 model in Copilot.Nov28,07:04UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for CopilotNov28,06:59UTC\u2190Incident HistoryPowered by Atlassian StatuspageGitHub text logoSubscribe to our developer newsletterGet tips, technical guides, and best practices.
