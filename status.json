The incident is attributed to OAuth scope mismatches between different internal services. Approximately 17,168 clients could be potentially affected, involving several cloud instances. The incident has resulted in 2LO permissions being incorrectly enabled, causing potential access issues. Some customers may notice unauthorized system users in their directories, which currently pose no identified security risk.Current StatusThe short term fix involving Workspace ARI's will be rolled out cautiously over today and should resolve some highly impacted installations.Full restoration via backfill scripts is being developed, though this will at least take the remainder of the week to cautiously roll out to production.Next StepsThe backfill process for a permanent data correction is set to begin, with rigorous monitoring planned to observe system behavior.New communication updates are scheduled to occur within the next 12 hours, or sooner if significant developments arise.If you believe that you are impacted by this incident, and need assistance, then we recommend raising a support ticket.Feb16,00:24UTCUpdate-Our teams identified two fix paths: a quick fix and a longer, time-consuming fix.

We are continuing to investigate.Feb18,18:26UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Feb18,18:25UTCFeb17,2026Intermittent authentication failures on GitHubResolved-On February 17, 2026, between 17:07 UTC and 19:06 UTC, some customers experienced intermittent authentication failures affecting GitHub Actions, parts of Git operations, and other authentication-dependent requests. On average, the Actions error rate was approximately 0.6% of affected API requests. Git operations ssh read error rate was approximately 0.29%, while ssh write and http operations were not impacted. During the incident, a subset of requests failed due to token verification lookups intermittently failing, leading to 401 errors and degraded reliability for impacted workflows.The issue was caused by elevated replication lag in the token verification database cluster. In the days leading up to the incident, the token store\u2019s write volume grew enough to exceed the cluster\u2019s available capacity. Under peak load, older replica hosts were unable to keep up, replica lag increased, and some token lookups became inconsistent, resulting in intermittent authentication failures.We mitigated the incident by adjusting the database replica topology to route reads away from lagging replicas and by adding/bringing additional replica capacity online. Service health improved progressively after the change, with GitHub Actions recovering by ~19:00 UTC and the incident resolved at 19:06 UTC.We are working to prevent recurrence by improving the resilience and scalability of our underlying token verification data stores to better handle continued growth.Feb17,19:06UTCUpdate-We are continuing to monitor the mitigation and continuing to see signs of recovery.Feb17,18:55UTCUpdate-We have rolled out a mitigation and are seeing signs of recovery and are continuing to monitor.Feb17,18:18UTCUpdate-We have identified a low rate of authentication failures affecting GitHub App server to server tokens, GitHub Actions authentication tokens, and git operations. Some customers may experience intermittent API request failures when using these tokens. We believe we've identified the cause and are working to mitigate impact.Feb17,17:46UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Actions and Git OperationsFeb17,17:46UTCFeb16,2026No incidents reported.Feb15,2026No incidents reported.Feb14,2026No incidents reported.Feb13,2026Disruption with some GitHub services regarding file uploadResolved-On February 13, 2026, between 21:46 UTC and 22:58 UTC (72 minutes), the GitHub file upload service was degraded and users uploading from a web browser on GitHub.com were unable to upload files to repositories, create release assets, or upload manifest files. During the incident, successful upload completions dropped by ~85% from baseline levels. This was due to a code change that inadvertently modified browser request behavior and violated CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy requirements, causing upload requests to be blocked before reaching the upload service.We mitigated the incident by reverting the code change that introduced the issue.We are working to improve automated testing for browser-side request changes and to add monitoring/automated safeguards for upload flows to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of similar issues in the future.Feb13,22:58UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Feb13,22:30UTCFeb12,2026Disruption with some GitHub servicesResolved-Between February 11th 21:30 UTC and February 12th 15:40 UTC, users in Western Europe experienced degraded quality for all Next Edit Suggestions requests. Additionally, on February 12th, between 18:40 UTC and 20:30 UTC, users in Australia and South America experienced degraded quality and increased latency of up to 500ms for all Next Edit Suggestions requests. The root cause was a newly introduced regression in an upstream service dependency.The incident was mitigated by failing over Next Edit Suggestions traffic to unaffected regions, which caused the increased latency. Once the regression was identified and rolled back, we restored the impacted capacity. We have improved our quality analysis tooling and are working on more robust quality impact alerting to accelerate detection of these issues in the future.Feb12,20:34UTCUpdate-Next Edit Suggestions availability is recovering. We are continuing to monitor until fully restored.Feb12,19:59UTCUpdate-We are experiencing degraded availability in Australia and Brazil for Copilot completions and suggestions.

We are working to resolve the issue.Feb12,14:08UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Feb12,14:06UTCDisruption with some GitHub servicesResolved-From Feb 12, 2026 09:16:00 UTC to Feb 12, 2026 11:01 UTC, users attempting to download repository archives (tar.gz/zip) that include Git LFS objects received errors. Standard repository archives without LFS objects were not affected. On average, the archive download error rate was 0.0042% and peaked at 0.0339% of requests to the service. This was caused by deploying a corrupt configuration bundle, resulting in missing data used for network interface connections by the service.We mitigated the incident by applying the correct configuration to each site. We have added checks for corruption in this deployment, and will add auto-rollback detection for this service to prevent issues like this in the future.Feb12,11:12UTCUpdate-We have resolved the issue and are seeing full recovery.Feb12,11:01UTCUpdate-We are investigating an issue with downloading repository archives that include Git LFS objects.Feb12,10:39UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Feb12,10:38UTCIncident with CodespacesResolved-On February 12, 2026, between 00:51 UTC and 09:35 UTC, users attempting to create or resume Codespaces experienced elevated failure rates across Europe, Asia and Australia, peaking at a 90% failure rate.The disconnects were triggered by a bad configuration rollout in a core networking dependency, which led to internal resource provisioning failures. We are working to improve our alerting thresholds to catch issues before they impact customers and strengthening rollout safeguards to prevent similar incidents.Feb12,09:56UTCUpdate-Recovery looks consistent with Codespaces creating and resuming successfully across all regions.Thank you for your patience.Feb12,09:56UTCUpdate-Codespaces is experiencing degraded performance. We are continuing to investigate.Feb12,09:42UTCUpdate-We are seeing widespread recovery across all our regions.We will continue to monitor progress and will resolve the incident when we are confident on durable recovery.Feb12,09:39UTCUpdate-We have identified the issue causing Codespace create/resume actions to fail and are applying a fix. This is estimated to take ~2 hours to complete but impact will begin to reduce sooner than that.We will continue to monitor recovery progress and will report back when more information is available.Feb12,09:04UTCUpdate-We now understand the source of the VM create/resume failures and are working with our partners to mitigate the impact.Feb12,08:32UTCUpdate-We are seeing an increase in Codespaces creation and resuming failures across multiple regions, primarily in EMEA. Our team are analysing the situation and are working to mitigate this impact.While we are working, customers are advised to create Codespaces in US East and US West regions via the \"New with options...\" button when creating a Codespace.More updates as we have them.Feb12,08:02UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded availability for CodespacesFeb12,07:53UTCDisruption with some GitHub servicesResolved-On February 11 between 16:37 UTC and 00:59 UTC the following day, 4.7% of workflows running on GitHub Larger Hosted Runners were delayed by an average of 37 minutes. Standard Hosted and self-hosted runners were not impacted.This incident was caused by capacity degradation in Central US for Larger Hosted Runners. Workloads not pinned to that region were picked up by other regions, but were delayed as those regions became saturated. Workloads configured with private networking in that region were delayed until compute capacity in that region recovered. The issue was mitigated by rebalancing capacity across internal and external workloads and general increases in capacity in affected regions to speed recovery.In addition to working with our compute partners on the core capacity degradation, we are working to ensure other regions are better able to absorb load with less delay to customer workloads. For pinned workflows using private networking, we are shipping support soon for customers to failover if private networking is configured in a paired region.Feb12,00:59UTCUpdate-Actions is experiencing capacity constraints with larger hosted runners, leading to high wait times. Standard hosted labels and self-hosted runners are not impacted.The issue is mitigated and we are monitoring recovery.Feb11,21:33UTCUpdate-We're continuing to work toward mitigation with our capacity provider, and adding capacity.Feb11,19:37UTCUpdate-Actions is experiencing capacity constraints with larger hosted runners, leading to high wait times. Standard hosted labels and self-hosted runners are not impacted.We're working with the capacity provider to mitigate the impact.Feb11,19:00UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Feb11,18:58UTCFeb11,2026Incident with API RequestsResolved-On February 11, 2026, between 13:51 UTC and 17:03 UTC, the GraphQL API experienced degraded performance due to elevated resource utilization. This resulted in incoming client requests waiting longer than normal, timing out in certain cases. During the impact window, approximately 0.65% of GraphQL requests experienced these issues, peaking at 1.06%.The increased load was due to an increase in query patterns that drove higher than expected resource utilization of the GraphQL API. We mitigated the incident by scaling out resource capacity and limiting the capacity available to these query patterns.We're improving our telemetry to identify slow usage growth and changes in GraphQL workloads. We\u2019ve also added capacity safeguards to prevent similar incidents in the future.Feb11,17:15UTCUpdate-We've observed recovery for the GraphQL service latency.Feb11,17:13UTCUpdate-We're continuing to remediate the service degradation and scaling out to further mitigate the potential for latency impact.Feb11,16:54UTCUpdate-We've identified a dependency of GraphQL that is in a degraded state and are working on remediating the issue.Feb11,15:54UTCUpdate-We're investigating increased latency for GraphQL traffic.Feb11,15:27UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for API RequestsFeb11,15:26UTCIncident with CopilotResolved-On February 11, 2025, between 14:30 UTC and 15:30 UTC, the Copilot service experienced degraded availability for requests to Claude Haiku 4.5. During this time, on average 10% of requests failed with 23% of sessions impacted. The issue was caused by an upstream problem from multiple external model providers that affected our ability to serve requests.The incident was mitigated once one of the providers resolved the issue and we rerouted capacity fully to that provider. We have improved our telemetry to improve incident observability and implemented an automated retry mechanism for requests to this model to mitigate similar future upstream incidents.Feb11,15:46UTCUpdate-Copilot is operating normally.Feb11,15:46UTCUpdate-The issues with our upstream model provider have been resolved, and Claude Haiku 4.5 is once again available in Copilot Chat and across IDE integrations.We will continue monitoring to ensure stability, but mitigation is complete.Feb11,15:46UTCUpdate-We are experiencing degraded availability for the Claude Haiku 4.5 model in Copilot Chat, VS Code and other Copilot products. This is due to an issue with an upstream model provider. We are working with them to resolve the issue.Other models are available and working as expected.Feb11,15:27UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for CopilotFeb11,15:26UTCFeb10,2026Disruption with some GitHub servicesResolved-On February 10th, 2026, between 14:35 UTC and 15:58 UTC web experiences on GitHub.com were degraded including Pull Requests and Authentication, resulting in intermittent 5xx errors and timeouts. The error rate on web traffic peaked at approximately 2%. This was due to increased load on a critical database, which caused significant memory pressure resulting in intermittent errors.We mitigated the incident by applying a configuration change to the database to increase available memory on the host.We are working to identify changes in load patterns and are reviewing the configuration of our databases to ensure there is sufficient capacity to meet growth.
