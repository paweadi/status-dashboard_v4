During this time, Actions jobs queued and timed out while waiting to acquire a hosted runner. Other GitHub features that leverage this compute infrastructure were similarly impacted, including Copilot Coding Agent, Copilot Code Review, CodeQL, Dependabot, GitHub Enterprise Importer, and Pages. All regions and runner types were impacted. Self-hosted runners on other providers were not impacted.This outage was caused by a backend storage access policy change in our underlying compute provider that blocked access to critical VM metadata, causing all VM create, delete, reimage, and other operations to fail. More information is available athttps://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status/history/?trackingId=FNJ8-VQZ. This was mitigated by rolling back the policy change, which started at 22:15 UTC.  As VMs came back online, our runners worked through the backlog of requests that hadn\u2019t timed out.We are working with our compute provider to improve our incident response and engagement time, improve early detection before they impact our customers, and ensure safe rollout should similar changes occur in the future.

Impacted users could observe Actions finish successfully but the session UI continuing to show in-progress state, or sessions remaining in queued state.The issue was caused by a feature flag that resulted in events being published to a new Kafka topic. Publishing failures led to buffer/queue overflows in the shared event publishing client, preventing other critical events from being emitted. We mitigated the incident by disabling the feature flag and redeploying production pods, which resumed normal event delivery. We are working to improve safeguards and detection around event publishing failures to reduce time to mitigation for similar issues in the future.Jan30,21:22UTCUpdate-Customers may experience misreported Copilot Coding Agent tasks in the GitHub UI. Although the underlying actions are completing as requested, surfaces like Agent Sessions on the GitHub website, or Agent Hub in VS Code, will show that an agent is still working on a task, even if that work has completed.We are working to understand the root cause and mitigate these discrepancies.Jan30,21:05UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for ActionsJan30,20:59UTCJan29,2026No incidents reported.Jan28,2026Actions Workflows Run Start DelaysResolved-On Jan 28, 2026, between 14:56 UTC and 15:44 UTC, GitHub Actions experienced degraded performance. During this time, workflows experienced an average delay of 49 seconds, and 4.7% of workflow runs failed to start within 5 minutes. The root cause was an atypical load pattern that overwhelmed system capacity and caused resource contention.Recovery began once additional resources came online at 15:25 UTC, with full recovery at 15:44 UTC. We are implementing safeguards to prevent this failure mode and enhancing our monitoring to detect and address similar patterns more quickly in the future.Jan28,15:54UTCUpdate-Actions workflow run starts are delayed. We are actively investigating to find a mitigation.Jan28,15:37UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for ActionsJan28,15:12UTCJan27,2026No incidents reported.Jan26,2026Regression in windows runners for public repositoriesResolved-On Jan 26, 2026, from approximately 14:03 UTC to 23:42 UTC, GitHub Actions experienced job failures on some Windows standard hosted runners. This was caused by a configuration difference in a new Windows runner type that caused the expected D: drive to be missing. About 2.5% of all Windows standard runners jobs were impacted. Re-run of failed workflows had a high chance of succeeding given the limited rollout of the change.The job failures were mitigated by rolling back the affected configuration and removing the provisioned runners that had this configuration. To reduce the chance of recurrence, we are expanding runner telemetry and improving validation of runner configuration changes. We are also evaluating options to accelerate the mitigation time of any similar future events.Jan26,23:51UTCUpdate-At 23:45 UTC we applied a mitigation to take remaining impacted capacity offline and are seeing improvement. We will update again once we've confirmed the issue is resolved.Jan26,23:49UTCUpdate-Our investigation into GitHub Actions 4 Core Windows runner failures in public repositories is ongoing.If you have a failing GitHub Actions run, please retry it and it is likely to succeed.Jan26,23:04UTCUpdate-We're continuing to investigate failures in GitHub Actions 4 Core Windows runners in public repositories.If you have a failing GitHub Actions run, please retry it and it is likely to succeed.Jan26,22:02UTCUpdate-Rollback has been completed, but we are still seeing failures on about 11% of GitHub Actions runs on 4 Core Windows runners in public repositories.If your workflow fails to start, try re-running and it is likely to work a second time.Jan26,21:20UTCUpdate-Mitigation for failing GitHub Actions jobs on 4-Core Windows runners is still being mitigated. You should start to see more runs succeeding.If you do see failing runs, please retry and they might succeed.Jan26,20:10UTCUpdate-We've applied a mitigation to unblock running Actions. A regression occurred for Windows runners in public repositories which caused Actions workflows to fail. A mitigation is in place and customers should expect to see resolution soon.If you have a failing Actions workflow on a Windows runner, please retry and it is likely to work.Jan26,19:32UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Jan26,19:25UTCJan25,2026Disruption with repo creationResolved-Between January 24, 2026,19:56 UTC and January 25, 2026, 2:50 UTC repository creation and clone were degraded. On average, the error rate was 25% and peaked at 55% of requests for repository creation. This was due to increased latency on the repositories database impacting a read-after-write problem during repo creation. We mitigated the incident by stopping an operation that was generating load on the database to increase throughput.We have identified the repository creation problem and are working to address the issue and improve our observability to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.Jan25,03:08UTCUpdate-The issue has been resolved. We will continue to monitor to ensure stability.Jan25,03:08UTCUpdate-Repo creation failure rate increased above 50%. We have mitigated the problem and are monitoring for recovery.Jan25,02:58UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Jan25,02:43UTCJan24,2026No incidents reported.Jan23,2026No incidents reported.Jan22,2026Disruption with some GitHub servicesResolved-On January 22, 2026, our authentication service experienced an issue between 14:00 UTC and 14:50 UTC, resulting in downstream disruptions for users.From 14:00 UTC to 14:23 UTC, authenticated API requests experienced higher-than-normal error rates, with an average of 16.9% and occasional peaks up to 22.2% resulting in HTTP 401 responses for authenticated API requests.From 14:00 UTC to 14:50 UTC, git operations over HTTP were impacted, with error rates averaging 3.8% and peaking at 10.8%. As a result, some users may have been unable to run git commands as expected.This was due to the authentication service reaching the maximum allowed number of database connections. We mitigated the incident by increasing the maximum number of database connections in the authentication service.We are adding additional monitoring around database connection pool usage and improving our traffic projection to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.Jan22,15:22UTCUpdate-We have identified an issue in one of our services and have mitigated it. Services have recovered and we have a mitigation but we are working on a longer term solution.Jan22,15:22UTCUpdate-Issues is operating normally.Jan22,14:27UTCUpdate-Issues is experiencing degraded performance. We are continuing to investigate.Jan22,14:23UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Jan22,14:12UTCJan21,2026Policy pages for Copilot are timing outResolved-On January 21, between 17:50 and 20:53 UTC, around 350 enterprises and organizations experienced slower load times or timeouts when viewing Copilot policy pages. The issue was traced to performance degradation under load due to an issue in upstream database caching capability within our billing infrastructure, which increased query latency to retrieve billing and policy information from approximately 300ms to up to 1.5s.To restore service, we disabled the affected caching feature, which immediately returned performance to normal. We then addressed the issue in the caching capability and re-enabled our use of the database cache and observed continued recovery.Moving forward, we\u2019re tightening our procedures for deploying performance optimizations, adding test coverage, and improving cross-service visibility and alerting so we can detect upstream degradations earlier and reduce impact to customers.Jan21,20:53UTCUpdate-We are rolling out a fix to reduce latency and timeouts on policy pages and are continuing to monitor impact.Jan21,20:47UTCUpdate-We are continuing to investigate latency and timeout issues affecting Copilot policy pages.Jan21,20:12UTCUpdate-We are investigating timeouts for customers visiting the Copilot policy pages for organizations and enterprises.Jan21,19:37UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Jan21,19:31UTCCopilot Chat - Grok Code Fast 1 OutageResolved-On Jan 21st, 2025, between 11:15 UTC and 13:00 UTC the Copilot service was degraded for Grok Code Fast 1 model. On average, more than 90% of the requests to this model failed due to an issue with an upstream provider. No other models were impacted.The issue was resolved after the upstream provider fixed the problem that caused the disruption. GitHub will continue to enhance our monitoring and alerting systems to reduce the time it takes to detect and mitigate similar issues in the future.Jan21,12:38UTCUpdate-We are experiencing degraded availability for the Grok Code Fast 1 model in Copilot Chat, VS Code and other Copilot products. This is due to an issue with an upstream model provider. We are working with them to resolve the issue.Other models are available and working as expected.Jan21,12:09UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for CopilotJan21,11:33UTC\u2190Incident HistoryPowered by Atlassian StatuspageGitHub text logoSubscribe to our developer newsletterGet tips, technical guides, and best practices.
