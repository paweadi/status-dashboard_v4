During the incident, successful upload completions dropped by ~85% from baseline levels. This was due to a code change that inadvertently modified browser request behavior and violated CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy requirements, causing upload requests to be blocked before reaching the upload service.We mitigated the incident by reverting the code change that introduced the issue.We are working to improve automated testing for browser-side request changes and to add monitoring/automated safeguards for upload flows to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of similar issues in the future.Feb13,22:58UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Feb13,22:30UTCFeb12,2026Disruption with some GitHub servicesResolved-Between February 11th 21:30 UTC and February 12th 15:40 UTC, users in Western Europe experienced degraded quality for all Next Edit Suggestions requests. Additionally, on February 12th, between 18:40 UTC and 20:30 UTC, users in Australia and South America experienced degraded quality and increased latency of up to 500ms for all Next Edit Suggestions requests. The root cause was a newly introduced regression in an upstream service dependency.The incident was mitigated by failing over Next Edit Suggestions traffic to unaffected regions, which caused the increased latency. Once the regression was identified and rolled back, we restored the impacted capacity. We have improved our quality analysis tooling and are working on more robust quality impact alerting to accelerate detection of these issues in the future.Feb12,20:34UTCUpdate-Next Edit Suggestions availability is recovering. We are continuing to monitor until fully restored.Feb12,19:59UTCUpdate-We are experiencing degraded availability in Australia and Brazil for Copilot completions and suggestions.

Additionally, on February 12th, between 18:40 UTC and 20:30 UTC, users in Australia and South America experienced degraded quality and increased latency of up to 500ms for all Next Edit Suggestions requests. The root cause was a newly introduced regression in an upstream service dependency.The incident was mitigated by failing over Next Edit Suggestions traffic to unaffected regions, which caused the increased latency. Once the regression was identified and rolled back, we restored the impacted capacity. We have improved our quality analysis tooling and are working on more robust quality impact alerting to accelerate detection of these issues in the future.Feb12,16:50UTCUpdate-We are experiencing degraded availability in Western Europe for Copilot completions and suggestions. We are working to resolve the issue.Feb12,15:33UTCUpdate-We are experiencing degraded availability in some regions for Copilot completions and suggestions. We are working to resolve the issue.Feb12,14:08UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Feb12,14:06UTCDisruption with some GitHub servicesResolved-From Feb 12, 2026 09:16:00 UTC to Feb 12, 2026 11:01 UTC, users attempting to download repository archives (tar.gz/zip) that include Git LFS objects received errors. Standard repository archives without LFS objects were not affected. On average, the archive download error rate was 0.0042% and peaked at 0.0339% of requests to the service. This was caused by deploying a corrupt configuration bundle, resulting in missing data used for network interface connections by the service.We mitigated the incident by applying the correct configuration to each site. We have added checks for corruption in this deployment, and will add auto-rollback detection for this service to prevent issues like this in the future.Feb12,11:12UTCUpdate-We have resolved the issue and are seeing full recovery.Feb12,11:01UTCUpdate-We are investigating an issue with downloading repository archives that include Git LFS objects.Feb12,10:39UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Feb12,10:38UTCIncident with CodespacesResolved-On February 12, 2026, between 00:51 UTC and 09:35 UTC, users attempting to create or resume Codespaces experienced elevated failure rates across Europe, Asia and Australia, peaking at a 90% failure rate.The disconnects were triggered by a bad configuration rollout in a core networking dependency, which led to internal resource provisioning failures. We are working to improve our alerting thresholds to catch issues before they impact customers and strengthening rollout safeguards to prevent similar incidents.Feb12,09:56UTCUpdate-Recovery looks consistent with Codespaces creating and resuming successfully across all regions.Thank you for your patience.Feb12,09:56UTCUpdate-Codespaces is experiencing degraded performance. We are continuing to investigate.Feb12,09:42UTCUpdate-We are seeing widespread recovery across all our regions.We will continue to monitor progress and will resolve the incident when we are confident on durable recovery.Feb12,09:39UTCUpdate-We have identified the issue causing Codespace create/resume actions to fail and are applying a fix. This is estimated to take ~2 hours to complete but impact will begin to reduce sooner than that.We will continue to monitor recovery progress and will report back when more information is available.Feb12,09:04UTCUpdate-We now understand the source of the VM create/resume failures and are working with our partners to mitigate the impact.Feb12,08:32UTCUpdate-We are seeing an increase in Codespaces creation and resuming failures across multiple regions, primarily in EMEA. Our team are analysing the situation and are working to mitigate this impact.While we are working, customers are advised to create Codespaces in US East and US West regions via the \"New with options...\" button when creating a Codespace.More updates as we have them.Feb12,08:02UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded availability for CodespacesFeb12,07:53UTCDisruption with some GitHub servicesResolved-On February 11 between 16:37 UTC and 00:59 UTC the following day, 4.7% of workflows running on GitHub Larger Hosted Runners were delayed by an average of 37 minutes. Standard Hosted and self-hosted runners were not impacted.This incident was caused by capacity degradation in Central US for Larger Hosted Runners. Workloads not pinned to that region were picked up by other regions, but were delayed as those regions became saturated. Workloads configured with private networking in that region were delayed until compute capacity in that region recovered. The issue was mitigated by rebalancing capacity across internal and external workloads and general increases in capacity in affected regions to speed recovery.In addition to working with our compute partners on the core capacity degradation, we are working to ensure other regions are better able to absorb load with less delay to customer workloads. For pinned workflows using private networking, we are shipping support soon for customers to failover if private networking is configured in a paired region.Feb12,00:59UTCUpdate-Actions is experiencing capacity constraints with larger hosted runners, leading to high wait times. Standard hosted labels and self-hosted runners are not impacted.The issue is mitigated and we are monitoring recovery.Feb11,21:33UTCUpdate-We're continuing to work toward mitigation with our capacity provider, and adding capacity.Feb11,19:37UTCUpdate-Actions is experiencing capacity constraints with larger hosted runners, leading to high wait times. Standard hosted labels and self-hosted runners are not impacted.We're working with the capacity provider to mitigate the impact.Feb11,19:00UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Feb11,18:58UTCFeb11,2026Incident with API RequestsResolved-On February 11, 2026, between 13:51 UTC and 17:03 UTC, the GraphQL API experienced degraded performance due to elevated resource utilization. This resulted in incoming client requests waiting longer than normal, timing out in certain cases. During the impact window, approximately 0.65% of GraphQL requests experienced these issues, peaking at 1.06%.The increased load was due to an increase in query patterns that drove higher than expected resource utilization of the GraphQL API. We mitigated the incident by scaling out resource capacity and limiting the capacity available to these query patterns.We're improving our telemetry to identify slow usage growth and changes in GraphQL workloads. We\u2019ve also added capacity safeguards to prevent similar incidents in the future.Feb11,17:15UTCUpdate-We've observed recovery for the GraphQL service latency.Feb11,17:13UTCUpdate-We're continuing to remediate the service degradation and scaling out to further mitigate the potential for latency impact.Feb11,16:54UTCUpdate-We've identified a dependency of GraphQL that is in a degraded state and are working on remediating the issue.Feb11,15:54UTCUpdate-We're investigating increased latency for GraphQL traffic.Feb11,15:27UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for API RequestsFeb11,15:26UTCIncident with CopilotResolved-On February 11, 2025, between 14:30 UTC and 15:30 UTC, the Copilot service experienced degraded availability for requests to Claude Haiku 4.5. During this time, on average 10% of requests failed with 23% of sessions impacted. The issue was caused by an upstream problem from multiple external model providers that affected our ability to serve requests.The incident was mitigated once one of the providers resolved the issue and we rerouted capacity fully to that provider. We have improved our telemetry to improve incident observability and implemented an automated retry mechanism for requests to this model to mitigate similar future upstream incidents.Feb11,15:46UTCUpdate-Copilot is operating normally.Feb11,15:46UTCUpdate-The issues with our upstream model provider have been resolved, and Claude Haiku 4.5 is once again available in Copilot Chat and across IDE integrations.We will continue monitoring to ensure stability, but mitigation is complete.Feb11,15:46UTCUpdate-We are experiencing degraded availability for the Claude Haiku 4.5 model in Copilot Chat, VS Code and other Copilot products. This is due to an issue with an upstream model provider. We are working with them to resolve the issue.Other models are available and working as expected.Feb11,15:27UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for CopilotFeb11,15:26UTCFeb10,2026Disruption with some GitHub servicesResolved-On February 10th, 2026, between 14:35 UTC and 15:58 UTC web experiences on GitHub.com were degraded including Pull Requests and Authentication, resulting in intermittent 5xx errors and timeouts. The error rate on web traffic peaked at approximately 2%. This was due to increased load on a critical database, which caused significant memory pressure resulting in intermittent errors.We mitigated the incident by applying a configuration change to the database to increase available memory on the host.We are working to identify changes in load patterns and are reviewing the configuration of our databases to ensure there is sufficient capacity to meet growth.

The first period occurred between 16:12 UTC and 17:39 UTC, and the second between 18:53 UTC and 20:09 UTC. In total, users experienced approximately 2 hours and 43 minutes of degraded service across the two incidents.During both incidents, users encountered errors loading pages on GitHub.com, failures when pushing or pulling code over HTTPS, failures starting or completing GitHub Actions workflow runs, and errors using GitHub Copilot. Additional services including GitHub Issues, pull requests, webhooks, Dependabot, GitHub Pages, and GitHub Codespaces experienced intermittent errors. SSH-based Git operations were not affected during either incident.Our investigation determined that both incidents shared the same underlying cause: a configuration change to a user settings caching mechanism caused a large volume of cache rewrites to occur simultaneously. During the first incident, asynchronous rewrites overwhelmed a shared infrastructure component responsible for coordinating background work, triggering cascading failures. Increased load caused the service responsible for proxying Git operations over HTTPS to exhaust available connections, preventing it from accepting new requests. We mitigated this incident by disabling async cache rewrites and restarting the affected Git proxy service across multiple datacenters.An additional source of updates to the same cache circumvented our initial mitigations and caused the second incident. This generated a high volume of synchronous writes, causing replication delays that cascaded in a similar pattern and again exhausted the Git proxy\u2019s connection capacity, degrading availability across multiple services. We mitigated by disabling the source of the cache rewrites and again restarting Git proxy.We know these incidents disrupted the workflows of millions of developers. While we have made substantial, long-term investments in how GitHub is built and operated to improve resilience, GitHub's availability is not yet meeting our expectations. Getting there requires deep architectural work that is already underway, as well as urgent, targeted improvements. We are taking the following immediate steps:1. We have already optimized the caching mechanism to avoid write amplification and added self-throttling during bulk updates.2. We are adding safeguards to ensure the caching mechanism responds more quickly to rollbacks and strengthening how changes to these caching systems are planned, validated, and rolled out with additional checks.3. We are fixing the underlying cause of connection exhaustion in our Git HTTPS proxy layer so the proxy can recover from this failure mode automatically without requiring manual restarts.GitHub is critical infrastructure for your work, your teams, and your businesses. We're focusing on these mitigations and long-term infrastructure work so GitHub is available, at scale, when and where you need it.Feb9,20:09UTCUpdate-Actions, Codespaces, Git Operations, Issues, Packages, Pages, Pull Requests and Webhooks are operating normally.Feb9,20:09UTCUpdate-We are seeing all services have returned to normal processing.Feb9,20:08UTCUpdate-A number of services have recovered, but we are continuing to investigate issues with Dependabot, Actions, and a number of other services.We will continue to investigate and monitor for full recovery.Feb9,19:54UTCUpdate-Codespaces is experiencing degraded performance.

Our team started investigating.Around 14:30 UTC the service started to recover as the team continued investigating the incident. Around 15:20 UTC degradation resurfaced, with increasing delays in notification deliveries and small error rate (below 1%) on UI and API endpoints related to notifications.At 16:30 UTC, we mitigated the incident by reducing contention through throttling workloads and performing a database failover. The median delay for notification deliveries was 80 minutes at this point and queues started emptying. Around 19:30 UTC the backlog of notifications was processed, bringing the service back to normal and declaring the incident closed.The incident was caused by the notifications database showing degradation under intense load. Most notifications-related asynchronous workloads, including notifications deliveries, were stopped to try to reduce the pressure on the database. To ensure system stability, a database failover was executed. Following the failover, we applied a configuration change to improve the performance. The service started recovering after these changes.We are reviewing the configuration of our databases to understand the performance drop and prevent similar issues from happening in the future. We are also investing in monitoring to detect and mitigate this class of incidents faster.Feb9,19:29UTCUpdate-We continue observing recovery of the notifications.   Notification delivery delays have been resolved.Feb9,19:14UTCUpdate-We are continuing to recover from notification delivery delays.

Approximately 0.6% of runs across 1.8% of repos were affected, with an average delay of 19 minutes for those delayed runs.The incident occurred when increased load exposed a bottleneck in our event publishing system, causing one compute node to fall behind on processing Actions Jobs. We mitigated by rebalancing traffic and increasing timeouts for event processing. We have since isolated performance critical events to a new, dedicated publisher to prevent contention between events and added safeguards to better tolerate processing timeouts.Feb9,15:46UTCUpdate-Actions is operating normally.Feb9,15:46UTCUpdate-Actions run delays have returned to normal levels.Feb9,15:46UTCUpdate-We identified a bottleneck in our processing pipeline and have applied mitigations.

The primary impact was to agent-based workflows (requests to /agents/swe/*, including custom agent configuration checks), where 154k users saw failed requests and error responses in their editor/agent experience. Impact was concentrated among users and integrations actively using Copilot Coding Agent with VS Code.The degradation was caused by an unexpected surge in traffic to the related API endpoints that exceeded an internal secondary rate limit. That resulted in upstream request denials which were surfaced to users as elevated 500 errors.We mitigated the incident by deploying a change that increased the applicable rate limit for this traffic, which allowed requests to complete successfully and returned the service to normal operation.After the mitigation, we deployed guardrails with applicable caching to avoid a repeat of similar incidents. We also temporarily increased infrastructure capacity to better handle backlog recovery from the rate limiting. We're are improving monitoring around growing agentic API endpoints.Feb9,12:12UTCUpdate-We are continuing to investigate the degraded availability for Copilot Coding Agent.Feb9,11:14UTCUpdate-We are investigating degraded availability for Copilot Coding Agent. We will continue to keep users updated on progress towards mitigation.Feb9,10:04UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Feb9,10:01UTCDegraded Performance in Webhooks API and UI, Pull RequestsResolved-On February 9, 2026, between 07:05 UTC and 11:26 UTC, GitHub experienced intermittent degradation across Issues, Pull Requests, Webhooks, Actions, and Git operations. Approximately every 30 minutes, users encountered brief periods of elevated errors and timeouts lasting roughly 15 seconds each. During the incident window, approximately 1\u20132% of requests were impacted across these services, with Git operations experiencing up to 7% error rates during individual spikes. GitHub Actions saw up to 2% of workflow runs delayed by a median of approximately 7 minutes due to backups created during these periods.This was due to multiple resource-intensive workloads running simultaneously, which caused intermittent processing delays on the data storage layer. We mitigated the incident by scaling storage to a larger compute capacity, which resolved the processing delays.We are working to improve detection of resource-intensive queries, identify changes in load patterns, and enhance our monitoring to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.Feb9,11:26UTCUpdate-Actions is operating normally.Feb9,11:26UTCUpdate-Issues is operating normally.Feb9,11:26UTCUpdate-Webhooks is operating normally.Feb9,11:26UTCUpdate-Pull Requests is operating normally.Feb9,11:26UTCUpdate-We have identified a faulty infrastructure component and have failed over to a healthy instance.
