Standard repository archives without LFS objects were not affected. On average, the archive download error rate was 0.0042% and peaked at 0.0339% of requests to the service. This was caused by deploying a corrupt configuration bundle, resulting in missing data used for network interface connections by the service.We mitigated the incident by applying the correct configuration to each site. We have added checks for corruption in this deployment, and will add auto-rollback detection for this service to prevent issues like this in the future.Feb12,11:12UTCUpdate-We have resolved the issue and are seeing full recovery.Feb12,11:01UTCUpdate-We are investigating an issue with downloading repository archives that include Git LFS objects.Feb12,10:39UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Feb12,10:38UTCIncident with CodespacesResolved-On February 12, 2026, between 00:51 UTC and 09:35 UTC, users attempting to create or resume Codespaces experienced elevated failure rates across Europe, Asia and Australia, peaking at a 90% failure rate.The disconnects were triggered by a bad configuration rollout in a core networking dependency, which led to internal resource provisioning failures.

The error rate on web traffic peaked at approximately 2%. This was due to increased load on a critical database, which caused significant memory pressure resulting in intermittent errors.We mitigated the incident by applying a configuration change to the database to increase available memory on the host.We are working to identify changes in load patterns and are reviewing the configuration of our databases to ensure there is sufficient capacity to meet growth.

This may prevent newly enabled models from appearing when users try to access them.The team is actively investigating the cause and working on a resolution. We will provide updates as they become available.Feb9,16:30UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for CopilotFeb9,16:29UTCFeb9,2026Incident with Issues, Actions and Git OperationsResolved-On February 9, 2026, GitHub experienced two related periods of degraded availability affecting GitHub.com, the GitHub API, GitHub Actions, Git operations, GitHub Copilot, and other services. The first period occurred between 16:12 UTC and 17:39 UTC, and the second between 18:53 UTC and 20:09 UTC. In total, users experienced approximately 2 hours and 43 minutes of degraded service across the two incidents.During both incidents, users encountered errors loading pages on GitHub.com, failures when pushing or pulling code over HTTPS, failures starting or completing GitHub Actions workflow runs, and errors using GitHub Copilot. Additional services including GitHub Issues, pull requests, webhooks, Dependabot, GitHub Pages, and GitHub Codespaces experienced intermittent errors. SSH-based Git operations were not affected during either incident.Our investigation determined that both incidents shared the same underlying cause: a configuration change to a user settings caching mechanism caused a large volume of cache rewrites to occur simultaneously. During the first incident, asynchronous rewrites overwhelmed a shared infrastructure component responsible for coordinating background work, triggering cascading failures. Increased load caused the service responsible for proxying Git operations over HTTPS to exhaust available connections, preventing it from accepting new requests. We mitigated this incident by disabling async cache rewrites and restarting the affected Git proxy service across multiple datacenters.An additional source of updates to the same cache circumvented our initial mitigations and caused the second incident. This generated a high volume of synchronous writes, causing replication delays that cascaded in a similar pattern and again exhausted the Git proxy\u2019s connection capacity, degrading availability across multiple services. We mitigated by disabling the source of the cache rewrites and again restarting Git proxy.We know these incidents disrupted the workflows of millions of developers. While we have made substantial, long-term investments in how GitHub is built and operated to improve resilience, GitHub's availability is not yet meeting our expectations. Getting there requires deep architectural work that is already underway, as well as urgent, targeted improvements. We are taking the following immediate steps:1. We have already optimized the caching mechanism to avoid write amplification and added self-throttling during bulk updates.2. We are adding safeguards to ensure the caching mechanism responds more quickly to rollbacks and strengthening how changes to these caching systems are planned, validated, and rolled out with additional checks.3. We are fixing the underlying cause of connection exhaustion in our Git HTTPS proxy layer so the proxy can recover from this failure mode automatically without requiring manual restarts.GitHub is critical infrastructure for your work, your teams, and your businesses. We're focusing on these mitigations and long-term infrastructure work so GitHub is available, at scale, when and where you need it.Feb9,20:09UTCUpdate-Actions, Codespaces, Git Operations, Issues, Packages, Pages, Pull Requests and Webhooks are operating normally.Feb9,20:09UTCUpdate-We are seeing all services have returned to normal processing.Feb9,20:08UTCUpdate-A number of services have recovered, but we are continuing to investigate issues with Dependabot, Actions, and a number of other services.We will continue to investigate and monitor for full recovery.Feb9,19:54UTCUpdate-Codespaces is experiencing degraded performance.

We are continuing to investigate.Feb9,19:02UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Actions, Git Operations and IssuesFeb9,19:01UTCNotifications are delayedResolved-On February 9th notifications service started showing degradation around 13:50 UTC, resulting in an increase in notification delivery delays. Our team started investigating.Around 14:30 UTC the service started to recover as the team continued investigating the incident. Around 15:20 UTC degradation resurfaced, with increasing delays in notification deliveries and small error rate (below 1%) on UI and API endpoints related to notifications.At 16:30 UTC, we mitigated the incident by reducing contention through throttling workloads and performing a database failover. The median delay for notification deliveries was 80 minutes at this point and queues started emptying. Around 19:30 UTC the backlog of notifications was processed, bringing the service back to normal and declaring the incident closed.The incident was caused by the notifications database showing degradation under intense load. Most notifications-related asynchronous workloads, including notifications deliveries, were stopped to try to reduce the pressure on the database. To ensure system stability, a database failover was executed. Following the failover, we applied a configuration change to improve the performance. The service started recovering after these changes.We are reviewing the configuration of our databases to understand the performance drop and prevent similar issues from happening in the future. We are also investing in monitoring to detect and mitigate this class of incidents faster.Feb9,19:29UTCUpdate-We continue observing recovery of the notifications.   Notification delivery delays have been resolved.Feb9,19:14UTCUpdate-We are continuing to recover from notification delivery delays.

The first period occurred between 16:12 UTC and 17:39 UTC, and the second between 18:53 UTC and 20:09 UTC. In total, users experienced approximately 2 hours and 43 minutes of degraded service across the two incidents.During both incidents, users encountered errors loading pages on GitHub.com, failures when pushing or pulling code over HTTPS, failures starting or completing GitHub Actions workflow runs, and errors using GitHub Copilot. Additional services including GitHub Issues, pull requests, webhooks, Dependabot, GitHub Pages, and GitHub Codespaces experienced intermittent errors. SSH-based Git operations were not affected during either incident.Our investigation determined that both incidents shared the same underlying cause: a configuration change to a user settings caching mechanism caused a large volume of cache rewrites to occur simultaneously. During the first incident, asynchronous rewrites overwhelmed a shared infrastructure component responsible for coordinating background work, triggering cascading failures. Increased load caused the service responsible for proxying Git operations over HTTPS to exhaust available connections, preventing it from accepting new requests. We mitigated this incident by disabling async cache rewrites and restarting the affected Git proxy service across multiple datacenters.An additional source of updates to the same cache circumvented our initial mitigations and caused the second incident. This generated a high volume of synchronous writes, causing replication delays that cascaded in a similar pattern and again exhausted the Git proxy\u2019s connection capacity, degrading availability across multiple services. We mitigated by disabling the source of the cache rewrites and again restarting Git proxy.We know these incidents disrupted the workflows of millions of developers. While we have made substantial, long-term investments in how GitHub is built and operated to improve resilience, GitHub's availability is not yet meeting our expectations. Getting there requires deep architectural work that is already underway, as well as urgent, targeted improvements. We are taking the following immediate steps:1. We have already optimized the caching mechanism to avoid write amplification and added self-throttling during bulk updates.2. We are adding safeguards to ensure the caching mechanism responds more quickly to rollbacks and strengthening how changes to these caching systems are planned, validated, and rolled out with additional checks.3. We are fixing the underlying cause of connection exhaustion in our Git HTTPS proxy layer so the proxy can recover from this failure mode automatically without requiring manual restarts.GitHub is critical infrastructure for your work, your teams, and your businesses. We're focusing on these mitigations and long-term infrastructure work so GitHub is available, at scale, when and where you need it.Feb9,17:40UTCUpdate-Pull Requests is operating normally.Feb9,17:40UTCUpdate-Webhooks is operating normally.Feb9,17:39UTCUpdate-Actions is operating normally.Feb9,17:37UTCUpdate-We are seeing recovery across all products and are continuing to monitor service health.Feb9,17:32UTCUpdate-Pages is operating normally.Feb9,17:29UTCUpdate-Git Operations is operating normally.Feb9,17:26UTCUpdate-Issues is operating normally.Feb9,17:25UTCUpdate-Pages is experiencing degraded performance.

Approximately 0.6% of runs across 1.8% of repos were affected, with an average delay of 19 minutes for those delayed runs.The incident occurred when increased load exposed a bottleneck in our event publishing system, causing one compute node to fall behind on processing Actions Jobs. We mitigated by rebalancing traffic and increasing timeouts for event processing. We have since isolated performance critical events to a new, dedicated publisher to prevent contention between events and added safeguards to better tolerate processing timeouts.Feb9,15:46UTCUpdate-Actions is operating normally.Feb9,15:46UTCUpdate-Actions run delays have returned to normal levels.Feb9,15:46UTCUpdate-We identified a bottleneck in our processing pipeline and have applied mitigations.

The primary impact was to agent-based workflows (requests to /agents/swe/*, including custom agent configuration checks), where 154k users saw failed requests and error responses in their editor/agent experience. Impact was concentrated among users and integrations actively using Copilot Coding Agent with VS Code.The degradation was caused by an unexpected surge in traffic to the related API endpoints that exceeded an internal secondary rate limit. That resulted in upstream request denials which were surfaced to users as elevated 500 errors.We mitigated the incident by deploying a change that increased the applicable rate limit for this traffic, which allowed requests to complete successfully and returned the service to normal operation.After the mitigation, we deployed guardrails with applicable caching to avoid a repeat of similar incidents. We also temporarily increased infrastructure capacity to better handle backlog recovery from the rate limiting. We're are improving monitoring around growing agentic API endpoints.Feb9,12:12UTCUpdate-We are continuing to investigate the degraded availability for Copilot Coding Agent.Feb9,11:14UTCUpdate-We are investigating degraded availability for Copilot Coding Agent.

This impacted users on the newer comment-positioning flow available in version 1.244.0 of the mobile apps. Telemetry indicated that the failures increased as the Android rollout progressed. This was due to a defect in the new comment-positioning workflow that could result in the server rejecting comment creation for certain deleted-line positions.We mitigated the incident by halting the Android rollout and implementing interim client-side fallback behavior while a platform fix is in progress. The client-side fallback is scheduled to be published early this week. We are working to (1) add clearer client-side error handling (avoid infinite spinners), (2) improve monitoring/alerting for these failures, and (3) adopt stable diff identifiers for diff-based operations to reduce the likelihood of recurrence.Feb6,18:36UTCUpdate-Some GitHub Mobile app users may be unable to add review comments on deleted lines in pull requests. We're working on a fix and expect to release it early next week.Feb6,18:36UTCUpdate-Pull Requests is operating normally.Feb6,18:04UTCUpdate-We're currently investigating an issue affecting the Mobile app that can prevent review comments from being posted on certain pull requests when commenting on deleted lines.Feb6,18:00UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Pull RequestsFeb6,17:49UTCIncident with CopilotResolved-On February 10, 2026, between 10:28 and 11:54 UTC, Visual Studio Code users experienced a degraded experience on GitHub Copilot when using the Claude Opus 4.6 model. During this time, approximately 50% of users encountered agent turn failures due to the model being unable to serve the volume of incoming requests.Rate limits set too low for actual demand caused the issue. While the initial deployment showed no concerns, a surge in traffic from Europe on the following day caused VSCode to begin hitting rate limit errors. Additionally, a degradation message intended to notify users of high usage failed to trigger due to a misconfiguration. We mitigated the incident by adjusting rate limits for the model.We improved our rate limiting to prevent future models from experiencing similar issues. We are also improving our capacity planning processes to reduce the risk of similar incidents in the future, and enhancing our detection and mitigation capabilities to reduce impact to customers.Feb6,11:58UTCUpdate-Copilot is operating normally.Feb6,11:58UTCUpdate-We have increased capacity and are seeing recovery.Feb6,11:57UTCUpdate-Opus 4.6 is currently experiencing high demand and we are working on adding capacity.Feb6,11:21UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for CopilotFeb6,11:16UTCFeb5,2026No incidents reported.Feb4,2026No incidents reported.Feb3,2026Delays in UI updates for Actions RunsResolved-On February 3, 2026, between 14:00 UTC and 17:40 UTC, customers experienced delays in Webhook delivery for push events and delayed GitHub Actions workflow runs. During this window, Webhook deliveries for push events were delayed by up to 40 minutes, with an average delay of 10 minutes. GitHub Actions workflows triggered by push events experienced similar job start delays. Additionally, between 15:25 UTC and 16:05 UTC, all GitHub Actions workflow runs experienced status update delays of up to 11 minutes, with a median delay of 6 minutes.The issue stemmed from connection churn in our eventing service, which caused CPU saturation and delays for reads and writes, with subsequent downstream delivery delays for Actions and Webhooks. We have added observability tooling and metrics to accelerate detection, and are correcting stream processing client configuration to prevent recurrence.Feb3,19:28UTCUpdate-Our telemetry shows improvement on latency in job status updates. We will continue monitoring until full recovery.Feb3,18:06UTCUpdate-We've applied a mitigation to improve system throughput and are monitoring for reduced latency for job status updates.Feb3,16:51UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for ActionsFeb3,16:10UTCIncident with CopilotResolved-On February 3, 2026, between 09:35 UTC and 10:15 UTC, GitHub Copilot experienced elevated error rates, with an average of 4% of requests failing.This was caused by a capacity imbalance that led to resource exhaustion on backend services. The incident was resolved by infrastructure rebalancing, and we subsequently deployed additional capacity.We are improving observability to detect capacity imbalances earlier and enhancing our infrastructure to better handle traffic spikes.Feb3,10:56UTCUpdate-We are now seeing recovery.Feb3,10:55UTCUpdate-We are investigating elevated 500s across Copilot services.Feb3,10:21UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for CopilotFeb3,10:16UTCIncident with ActionsResolved-On February 2, 2026, between 18:35 UTC and 22:15 UTC, GitHub Actions hosted runners were unavailable, with service degraded until full recovery at 23:10 UTC for standard runners and at February 3, 2026 00:30 UTC for larger runners. During this time, Actions jobs queued and timed out while waiting to acquire a hosted runner. Other GitHub features that leverage this compute infrastructure were similarly impacted, including Copilot Coding Agent, Copilot Code Review, CodeQL, Dependabot, GitHub Enterprise Importer, and Pages. All regions and runner types were impacted. Self-hosted runners on other providers were not impacted.This outage was caused by a backend storage access policy change in our underlying compute provider that blocked access to critical VM metadata, causing all VM create, delete, reimage, and other operations to fail. More information is available athttps://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status/history/?trackingId=FNJ8-VQZ. This was mitigated by rolling back the policy change, which started at 22:15 UTC.  As VMs came back online, our runners worked through the backlog of requests that hadn\u2019t timed out.We are working with our compute provider to improve our incident response and engagement time, improve early detection before they impact our customers, and ensure safe rollout should similar changes occur in the future.
