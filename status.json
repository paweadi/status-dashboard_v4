The errors are affecting the user copilot policies settings page, org copilot policies settings page when updating a policy.Dec18,17:36UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Dec18,17:36UTCIntermittent networking failures across GitHub-hosted Actions runnersResolved-On December 18th, 2025, from 08:15 UTC to 17:11 UTC, some GitHub Actions runners experienced intermittent timeouts for Github API calls, which led to failures during runner setup and workflow execution. This was caused by network packet loss between runners in the West US region and one of GitHub\u2019s edge sites. Approximately 1.5% of jobs on larger and standard hosted runners in the West US region were impacted, 0.28% of all Actions jobs during this period.By 17:11 UTC, all traffic was routed away from the affected edge site, mitigating the timeouts. We are working to improve early detection of cross-cloud connectivity issues and faster mitigation paths to reduce the impact of similar issues in the future.Dec18,17:41UTCUpdate-We are observing recovery with request from GitHub-hosted Actions runners and will continue to monitor.Dec18,17:29UTCUpdate-Since approximately 8:00 UTC, we have observed intermittent failures on GitHub-hosted actions runners. The failures have been observed both during runner setup, and workflow execution. We are continuing to investigate.Self-hosted runners are not impacted.Dec18,16:35UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for ActionsDec18,16:33UTCDec17,2025No incidents reported.Dec16,2025Incident With CopilotResolved-From 11:50-12:25 UTC, Copilot Coding Agent was unable to process new agent requests.  This affected all users creating new jobs during this timeframe, while existing jobs remained unaffected.  The cause of this issue was a change to the actions configuration where Copilot Coding Agent runs, which caused the setup of the Actions runner to fail, and the issue was resolved by rolling back this change.As a short term solution, we hope to increase our alerting criteria so that we can be alerted more quickly when an incident occurs, and in the long term we hope to harden our runner configuration to be more resilient against errors.Dec16,12:00UTCDec15,2025Copilot Code Review is degraded, and not returning responses to usersResolved-On December 15, 2025, between 15:15 UTC and 18:22 UTC, Copilot Code Review experienced a service degradation that caused 46.97% of pull request review requests to fail, requiring users to re-request a review. Impacted users saw the error message: \u201cCopilot encountered an error and was unable to review this pull request. You can try again by re-requesting a review.\u201d The remaining requests completed successfully.The degradation was caused by elevated response times in an internal, model-backed dependency, which led to request timeouts and backpressure in the review processing pipeline, resulting in sustained queue growth and failed review completion.We mitigated the issue by temporarily bypassing fix suggestions to reduce latency, increasing worker capacity to drain the backlog, and rolling out a model configuration change that reduced end-to-end latency. Queue depth and request success rates returned to normal and remained stable through peak traffic.Following the incident, we increased baseline worker capacity, added instrumentation for worker utilization and queue health, and are improving automatic load-shedding, fallback behavior, and alerting to reduce time to detection and mitigation for similar issues.Dec15,18:22UTCUpdate-We have seen recovery for Copilot Code Review requests and are investigating long-term availability and scaling strategiesDec15,18:21UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Dec15,17:43UTCIncident with Copilot Grok Code Fast 1Resolved-On Dec 15th, 2025, between 14:00 UTC and 15:45 UTC the Copilot service was degraded for Grok Code Fast 1 model. On average, 4% of the requests to this model failed due to an issue with our upstream provider. No other models were impacted.The issue was resolved after the upstream provider fixed the problem that caused the disruption. GitHub will continue to enhance our monitoring and alerting systems to reduce the time it takes to detect and mitigate similar issues in the future.Dec15,15:45UTCUpdate-We are continuing to work with our provider on resolving the incident with Grok Code Fast 1. Users can expect some requests to intermittently fail until all issues are resolved.Dec15,15:06UTCUpdate-We are experiencing degraded availability for the Grok Code Fast 1 model in Copilot Chat, VS Code and other Copilot products. This is due to an issue with an upstream model provider. We are working with them to resolve the issue.Other models are available and working as expected.Dec15,14:13UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for CopilotDec15,14:12UTCDec14,2025No incidents reported.Dec13,2025No incidents reported.Dec12,2025No incidents reported.Dec11,2025Disruptions in Login and Signup FlowsResolved-Between 13:25 UTC and 18:35 UTC on Dec 11th, GitHub experienced an increase in scraper activity on public parts of our website. This scraper activity caused a low priority web request pool to increase and eventually exceed total capacity resulting in users experiencing 500 errors. In particular, this affected Login, Logout, and Signup routes, along with less than 1% requests from within Actions jobs. At the peak of the incident, 7.6% of login requests were impacted, which was the most significant impact of this scraping attack.Our mitigation strategy identified the scraping activity and blocked it. We also increased the pool of web requests that were impacted to have more capacity, and lastly we upgraded key user login routes to higher priority queues.In future, we\u2019re working to more proactively identify this particular scraper activity and have faster mitigation times.Dec11,20:05UTCUpdate-We see signs of full recovery and will post a more in-depth update soon.Dec11,20:05UTCUpdate-We are continuing to monitor and continuing to see signs of recovery. We will update when we are confident that we are in full recovery.Dec11,19:58UTCUpdate-We've applied a mitigation to fix intermittent failures in anonymous requests and downloads from GitHub, including Login, Signup, Logout, and some requests from within Actions jobs. We are seeing improvements in telemetry, but we will continue to monitor for full recovery.Dec11,19:04UTCUpdate-We currently have ~7% of users experiencing errors when attempting to sign up, log in, or log out. We are deploying a change to mitigate these failures.Dec11,18:47UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Dec11,18:40UTCWe are investigating a rise in request failures on several servicesResolved-Between 13:25 UTC and 18:35 UTC on December 11th, GitHub experienced elevated traffic to portions of GitHub.com that exceeded previously provisioned capacity for specific request types.  As a result, users encountered intermittent 500 errors.  Impact was most pronounced on Login, Logout, and Signup pages, peaking at 7.6% of login requests. Additionally, fewer than 1% of requests originating from GitHub Actions jobs were affected.This incident was driven by the same underlying factors as the previously reporteddisruption to Login and Signup flowsOur immediate response focused on identifying and mitigating the source of the traffic increase.  We increased available capacity for web request handling to relieve pressure on constrained pools.  To reduce recurrence risk, we also re-routed critical authentication endpoints to a different traffic pool, ensuring sufficient isolation and headroom for login related traffic.In future, we\u2019re working to more proactively identify these large changes in traffic volume and improve our time to mitigation.Dec11,17:53UTCUpdate-Git Operations is operating normally.Dec11,17:20UTCUpdate-We believe that we have narrowed down our affected users to primarily those that are signing up or signing in as well as logged out usage. We are currently continuing to investigate the root cause and are working multiple mitigation angles.Dec11,17:19UTCUpdate-We are experiencing intermittent web request failures across multiple services, including login and authentication. Our teams are actively investigating the cause and working on mitigation.Dec11,16:41UTCUpdate-Codespaces, Copilot, Git Operations, Packages, Pages, Pull Requests and Webhooks are experiencing degraded performance. We are continuing to investigate.Dec11,16:09UTCUpdate-API Requests and Actions are experiencing degraded performance. We are continuing to investigate.Dec11,16:01UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for IssuesDec11,15:47UTCDec10,2025Some macOS Actions jobs routing to Ubuntu insteadResolved-Between December 9th, 2025 21:07 UTC and December 10th, 2025 14:52 UTC, 177 macos-14-large jobs were run on an Ubuntu larger runner VM instead of MacOS runner VMs. The impacted jobs were routed to a larger runner with incorrect metadata. We mitigated this by deleting the runner.The routing configuration is not something controlled externally. A manual override was done previously for internal testing, but left incorrect metadata for a large runner instance. An infrastructure migration caused this misconfigured runner to come online which started the incorrect assignments. We are removing the ability to manually override this configuration entirely, and are adding alerting to identify possible OS mismatches for hosted runner jobs.As a reminder, hosted runner VMs are secure and ephemeral, with every VM reimaged after every single job. All jobs impacted here were originally targeted at a GitHub-owned VM image and were run on a GitHub-owned VM image.Dec10,14:52UTCUpdate-We've applied a mitigation to ensure all macOS jobs route to macOS fulfillers and are monitoring for full recovery.Dec10,14:32UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for ActionsDec10,13:34UTCSome Actions customers experiencing run start delaysResolved-On December 10, 2025 between 08:50 UTC and 11:00 UTC, some GitHub Actions workflow runs experienced longer-than-normal wait times for jobs starting or completing. All jobs successfully completed despite the delays. At peak impact, approximately 8% of workflow runs were affected.During this incident, some nodes received a spike in workflow events that led to queuing of event processing. Because runs are pinned to nodes, runs being processed by these nodes saw delays in starting or showing as completed. The team was alerted to this at 8:58 UTC. Impacted nodes were disabled from processing new jobs to allow queues to drain.We have increased overall processing capacity and are implementing safeguards to better balance load across all nodes when spikes occur. This is important to ensure our available capacity can always be fully utilized.Dec10,11:05UTCUpdate-Actions is operating normally.Dec10,11:05UTCUpdate-We have validated the mitigation and are no longer seeing impact.Dec10,11:05UTCUpdate-We are seeing improvements in telemetry and are monitoring for full recovery.Dec10,10:58UTCUpdate-We've applied a mitigation to fix the issues with queuing and running Actions jobs. We will continue monitoring to confirm whether this resolves the issue.Dec10,10:25UTCUpdate-The team continues to investigate issues with some Actions jobs being queued for a long time. We will continue providing updates on the progress towards mitigation.Dec10,09:41UTCUpdate-We're investigating Actions workflow runs taking longer than expected to start.Dec10,09:13UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for ActionsDec10,09:11UTCDec9,2025No incidents reported.\u2190Incident HistoryPowered by Atlassian StatuspageGitHub text logoSubscribe to our developer newsletterGet tips, technical guides, and best practices.
