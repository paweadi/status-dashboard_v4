A tested and validated process is now running to restore affected apps and our team is closely monitoring traffic to help to rule out any issues.Please raise a support request if you require further assistance.An update will be provided within 72 hours with our status on the backfill operation and estimated time to completion.Feb17,05:40UTCUpdate-Our teams have identified customers that are actively experiencing issues relating to loss of access to their apps, and we are progressively rolling out a fix to these customers with urgency.We will provide further update within 24 hours or sooner if available.Feb16,05:30UTCUpdate-ImpactEcosystem, Jira, and Jira Service Management customers might experience API call failures when using OAuth 2.0 apps, receiving 'The app is not installed on this instance' errors. The incident is attributed to OAuth scope mismatches between different internal services. Approximately 17,168 clients could be potentially affected, involving several cloud instances. The incident has resulted in 2LO permissions being incorrectly enabled, causing potential access issues. Some customers may notice unauthorized system users in their directories, which currently pose no identified security risk.Current StatusThe short term fix involving Workspace ARI's will be rolled out cautiously over today and should resolve some highly impacted installations.Full restoration via backfill scripts is being developed, though this will at least take the remainder of the week to cautiously roll out to production.Next StepsThe backfill process for a permanent data correction is set to begin, with rigorous monitoring planned to observe system behavior.New communication updates are scheduled to occur within the next 12 hours, or sooner if significant developments arise.If you believe that you are impacted by this incident, and need assistance, then we recommend raising a support ticket.Feb16,00:24UTCUpdate-Our teams identified two fix paths: a quick fix and a longer, time-consuming fix. We will test the quick fix over the weekend and, if no issues arise, implement it on Monday.We will provide the next update on Monday, Feb 16, 2026.Feb13,07:41UTCIdentified-We have identified the cause of the issue, and our teams are diligently working on a mitigation.

On average, the error rate was 0.014% and peaked at 0.06% of requests to the service. Affected users saw 404 errors when navigating to repository directories and files with non-ASCII names. This was due to a code change that altered how file and directory names were processed, which caused incorrectly formatted data to be stored in an application cache.We mitigated the incident by deploying a fix that invalidated the affected cache entries and progressively rolling it out across all production environments.We are working to improve our pre-production testing to cover non-ASCII character handling, establish better cache invalidation mechanisms, and enhance our monitoring to detect this type of failure mode earlier, to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.Feb27,06:04UTCUpdate-We have cleared all caches and everything is operating normally.Feb27,06:03UTCUpdate-We have mitigated the issue but are working on invalidating caches in order to fix the issue for all impacted repos.Feb27,05:21UTCUpdate-We have performed a mitigation but some repositories may still see issues.

A detailed root cause analysis will be shared as soon as it is available.Feb25,16:44UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for CopilotFeb25,16:38UTCFeb24,2026Code search experiencing degraded performanceResolved-Between 2026-02-23 19:10 and 2026-02-24 00:46 UTC, all lexical code search queries in GitHub.com and the code search API were significantly slowed, and during this incident, between 5 and 10% of search queries timed out. This was caused by a single customer who had created a network of hundreds of orchestrated accounts which searched with a uniquely expensive search query. This search query concentrated load on a single hot shard within the search index, slowing down all queries. After we identified the source of the load and stopped the traffic, latency returned to normal.To avoid this situation occurring again in the future, we are making a number of improvements to our systems, including: improved rate limiting that accounts for highly skewed load on hot shards, improved system resilience for when a small number of shards time out, improved tooling to recognize abusive actors, and capabilities that will allow us to shed load on a single shard in emergencies.Feb24,00:46UTCUpdate-We have identified a cause for the latency and timeouts and have implemented a fix. We are observing initial recovery now.Feb24,00:38UTCUpdate-Customers using code search continue to see increased latency and timeout errors.

Standard, Mac, and Self-Hosted Runners were not impacted.The delays were caused by communication failures between backend services for one deployment of larger runners. Those failures prevented expected automated scaling and provisioning of larger hosted runner capacity within that deployment. This was mitigated when the affected infrastructure was recycled, larger runner pools in the affected deployment successfully scaled up, and queued jobs processed.We are working to improve the time to detect and diagnose this class of failures and improve the performance of recovery mechanisms for this degraded network state. In addition, we have architectural changes underway that will enable other deployments to pick up work in similar situations, so there is no customer impact due to deployment-specific infrastructure issues like this.Feb20,20:41UTCUpdate-The team continues to investigate issues with some larger runner jobs being queued for a long time. We are though seeing improvement in the queue times.

We will continue to keep users updated on progress towards mitigation.Feb18,18:27UTCUpdate-Pull Requests is experiencing degraded performance. We are continuing to investigate.Feb18,18:26UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of impacted performance for some GitHub services.Feb18,18:25UTCFeb17,2026Intermittent authentication failures on GitHubResolved-On February 17, 2026, between 17:07 UTC and 19:06 UTC, some customers experienced intermittent authentication failures affecting GitHub Actions, parts of Git operations, and other authentication-dependent requests. On average, the Actions error rate was approximately 0.6% of affected API requests. Git operations ssh read error rate was approximately 0.29%, while ssh write and http operations were not impacted. During the incident, a subset of requests failed due to token verification lookups intermittently failing, leading to 401 errors and degraded reliability for impacted workflows.The issue was caused by elevated replication lag in the token verification database cluster. In the days leading up to the incident, the token store\u2019s write volume grew enough to exceed the cluster\u2019s available capacity. Under peak load, older replica hosts were unable to keep up, replica lag increased, and some token lookups became inconsistent, resulting in intermittent authentication failures.We mitigated the incident by adjusting the database replica topology to route reads away from lagging replicas and by adding/bringing additional replica capacity online. Service health improved progressively after the change, with GitHub Actions recovering by ~19:00 UTC and the incident resolved at 19:06 UTC.We are working to prevent recurrence by improving the resilience and scalability of our underlying token verification data stores to better handle continued growth.Feb17,19:06UTCUpdate-We are continuing to monitor the mitigation and continuing to see signs of recovery.Feb17,18:55UTCUpdate-We have rolled out a mitigation and are seeing signs of recovery and are continuing to monitor.Feb17,18:18UTCUpdate-We have identified a low rate of authentication failures affecting GitHub App server to server tokens, GitHub Actions authentication tokens, and git operations. Some customers may experience intermittent API request failures when using these tokens. We believe we've identified the cause and are working to mitigate impact.Feb17,17:46UTCInvestigating-We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Actions and Git OperationsFeb17,17:46UTCFeb16,2026No incidents reported.Feb15,2026No incidents reported.\u2190Incident HistoryPowered by Atlassian StatuspageGitHub text logoSubscribe to our developer newsletterGet tips, technical guides, and best practices.
