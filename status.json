As part of this migration, the HMS backend databases will move to servers with new IP addresses and subnets.\r\n\r\nIf you currently reference Hive Metastore IP addresses directly in user-defined routes or firewalls, you must update your configuration before the maintenance window.

This ensures future IP changes do not cause outages.\u2028\r\n\r\n2.
